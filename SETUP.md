---

## 1 · AI Instructions

You are **ShipKit Setup Assistant**, guiding users through complete setup of the ADK Agent Simple application with Next.js web frontend, Python competitor analysis agent, Supabase database, and Google Cloud Platform and Vertex AI integration.

### Setup Process

You will guide users through 6 phases:

1. **Prerequisites & Environment Setup** - Install tools and create accounts
2. **Supabase Backend Setup** - Database and authentication (configures `apps/web/`)
3. **Web Application Setup** - Next.js app with chat interface (configures `apps/web/`)
4. **Google Cloud Platform & Vertex AI Setup** - GCP project, Vertex AI APIs, authentication, and Gemini API (configures both apps)
5. **Competitor Analysis Agent Setup** - Python agent configuration (configures `apps/competitor-analysis-agent/`)
6. **Integration & Production Testing** - End-to-end verification

### Communication Format

For each phase, use this exact format:

```
### 🚀 Phase [X]: [Phase Name]

**Goal:** [What we're accomplishing in this phase]

**🤖 AI Assistant will:**
- [Commands and automated tasks]

**👤 User will:**
- [Manual platform tasks]

Ready to begin? Let's start with the first step...
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Task Execution Requirements

- **Execute AI tasks immediately** - When you see "🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK", run commands without asking permission
- **Stop for user tasks** - When you see "👤 USER TASK", stop and wait for user approval/confirmation
- **Wait at stop points** - When you see "🛑 WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL", stop and don't proceed until the user gives approval or wants to continue (e.g. "continue", "proceed", "confirm", "approve", "yes", ...)
- **Use EXACT navigation paths** - When you see specific navigation instructions, use those exact words
- **No paraphrasing** - Follow template instructions precisely for platform navigation
- **No substitutions** - Stick to template paths, don't use your own navigation knowledge
- **Maintain consistency** - Users need predictable instructions that match the template

#### Execution Contract (Global)

- Execute commands verbatim as written in this guide: do not substitute, reorder, add/remove flags, or omit any part.
- DO NOT SKIP, COMPRESS, OR REINTERPRET STEPS; perform 100% of listed actions exactly as specified.
- When a step shows a directory, file path, variable name, or script, use it exactly as shown.
- If a command fails, retry once unchanged; if it still fails, stop and surface the exact error output without altering the command.
- Never replace a command with an "equivalent" alternative or manual updates (different tools, direct binaries, or aliases).
- Only proceed past "🛑 WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL" when the user gives approval (e.g. "continue", "proceed", "confirm", "approve", "yes", ...)

### Communication Best Practices

- ✅ **Be encouraging** - Celebrate wins and provide context for each step
- ✅ **Check understanding** - Ask "Does this make sense?" before moving on
- ✅ **Offer help** - "Let me know if you need help with any step"
- ✅ **Verify completion** - Confirm each step before proceeding to next phase

### Command Formatting

- **Never indent code blocks** - Keep flush left for easy copying
- **No leading whitespace** - Users need to copy commands easily
- **Execute commands verbatim** - Copy/paste and run commands exactly as shown (no alternate tools, flags, paths, or script names)
- **Reference troubleshooting** - Use troubleshooting section for errors

### Polyglot Architecture Awareness

- **TWO SEPARATE APPLICATIONS**: Next.js Frontend (`apps/web/`) + Python Agent Service (`apps/competitor-analysis-agent/`)
- **TWO .env.local files** to configure: `apps/web/.env.local` and `apps/competitor-analysis-agent/.env.local`
- **Multiple platforms** to configure: Supabase, Google Cloud Platform with Vertex AI

### Success Criteria

Setup is complete when all 6 phases are finished and user can successfully perform competitor analysis through the chat interface and interact with the intelligent agent.

---

## 4 · Database Migration Safety

### 🚨 CRITICAL WARNING FOR AI ASSISTANTS 🚨

**BEFORE EVERY DATABASE COMMAND, THE AI ASSISTANT MUST:**

1. **`pwd`** - Verify current directory
2. **`cd apps/web`** - Change to web app directory if not already there
3. **`pwd`** - Confirm you're now in `/path/to/project/apps/web`
4. **ONLY THEN** run `npm run db:*` commands

**❌ NEVER RUN DATABASE COMMANDS FROM:**

- Root project directory (`/path/to/project/`)
- Any other directory

**✅ ALWAYS RUN DATABASE COMMANDS FROM:**

- Web app directory (`/path/to/project/apps/web/`)

**🏗️ MIGRATION FILES BELONG IN:**

- `apps/web/drizzle/migrations/` ✅ CORRECT
- `drizzle/migrations/` ❌ WRONG LOCATION

---

### Down Migration Generation

This setup guide includes **automatic down migration generation** for all database schema changes to ensure safe rollback capabilities in production environments.

**🚨 CRITICAL: Migration Directory Context - NEVER FORGET THIS**
All Drizzle database operations must be executed in the **`apps/web/`** directory. **THE AI ASSISTANT MUST ALWAYS `cd apps/web` BEFORE EVERY DRIZZLE COMMAND**.

- **📂 Working Directory:** **ALWAYS `cd apps/web` BEFORE EVERY SINGLE DATABASE COMMAND**
- **📄 Migration Files:** Located in `apps/web/drizzle/migrations/` (NOT root `drizzle/migrations/`)
- **📝 Down Migrations:** Generated in `apps/web/drizzle/migrations/[timestamp]/down.sql`
- **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Never run Drizzle commands from the root project directory - this creates files in the wrong location
- **🔍 Verification:** Always run `pwd` to confirm you're in `/path/to/project/apps/web` before any `npm run db:*` command

**🔄 Migration Safety Process:**

- ✅ Generate and apply up migration (schema changes)
- ✅ **Generate down migration** Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`
- ✅ Test rollback capability in development
- ✅ Deploy with confidence knowing rollback is available

**📋 Template Reference:**
All down migrations are generated using the standardized **Drizzle Down Migration template** located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`. This template ensures:

- Safe rollback operations with `IF EXISTS` clauses
- Proper operation ordering (reverse of up migration)
- Data loss warnings for irreversible operations
- Manual intervention documentation where needed
- **Proper working directory context** (all operations in `apps/web/`)

**🛡️ Production Safety:**
Down migrations are essential for:

- **Zero-downtime deployments** with rollback capability
- **Disaster recovery** from failed migrations
- **A/B testing** database schema changes
- **Compliance requirements** for data governance

```


### Step 1.3: Setup Project Dependencies

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK:**

I'll now set up the project dependencies for both the web application and competitor analysis agent. This completes the actual setup of both applications.

```bash
# Verify we're in the root directory
pwd

# Install dependencies for both web app and competitor analysis agent
npm install
```

This single command installs dependencies for both applications:
- **Web Application**: Node.js dependencies and Next.js setup
- **Competitor Analysis Agent**: Python dependencies via UV package manager

---

## Phase 2: Supabase Backend Setup

**Goal:** Set up Supabase project with authentication and database configuration

**🤖 AI Assistant will:**

- Guide database schema setup and migrations
- Generate customized email templates based on project docs
- Configure database extensions and security policies

**👤 User will:**

- Create Supabase project and configure settings
- **Copy API keys and credentials immediately to the `apps/web/.env.local` environment file**
- Configure authentication settings and email templates

### Step 2.1: Prepare Environment Files

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Create Environment Files:**

Before setting up Supabase, I'll create the environment files for both applications.

```bash
# Create environment files for both applications
cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local
cp apps/competitor-analysis-agent/.env.local.example apps/competitor-analysis-agent/.env.local

# Verify files were created successfully
echo "✅ Checking environment files:"
ls -la apps/web/.env.local
ls -la apps/competitor-analysis-agent/.env.local
```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Environment files are now ready:

- `apps/web/.env.local` - For the Next.js frontend
- `apps/competitor-analysis-agent/.env.local` - For the Python competitor analysis agent

### Step 2.2: Create Supabase Account and Project

**👤 USER TASK - Create Supabase Account and Project:**

1. **Create Supabase Account**

   - Visit [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Sign up/Sign in with GitHub, SSO, or email

2. **Create New Project**

   - Click **"New Project"**
   - Choose your organization (or create one)
   - Fill in project details:
   - **Organization:** [your-organization-name]
   - **Project Name:** [your-project-name]
   - **Compute Size:** Micro (or larger based on your needs, only available for Pro organizations)
   - **Region:** us-east-1 (or closest to your users)

   💡 **Emphasize:** Always click **"Generate a password"** for security - Supabase will create a strong password for you.

3. **Generate and Save Database Password**

   - Under the password field, click **"Generate a password"**
   - The password field will be filled with a random, strong password
   - Click the **"Copy"** button (clipboard icon to the right of the password field) to copy the password

   **🛑 STOP! Save the password immediately before continuing:**

   **Step 3a: Save the Password Temporarily**

   - Inside your IDE (VS Code, Cursor, etc.), go to the project folder
   - **Open the `apps/web/.env.local` file** we created earlier
   - **Look for this line at the top of the file:**

```bash
# TEMP - Database password: [paste-generated-password-here] <------ ADD PASSWORD HERE TEMPORARILY.
```

- **Replace `[paste-generated-password-here]`** with the password you just copied
- **For example:** If the password you copied is `abcdefghij`, the line should look like:

```bash
# TEMP - Database password: abcdefghij <------ ADD PASSWORD HERE TEMPORARILY.
```

- **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

**✅ Checkpoint:** Your `apps/web/.env.local` file should now have your actual password saved in the comment line

**🔐 Why we do this:** Supabase will show you this password only once. After you create the project, you won't be able to see it again. We're saving it temporarily so we can use it later when setting up the database connection.

4. **Now Create the Project**
   - Go back to your browser with the Supabase project creation page
   - Click **"Create new project"**
   - Wait for Project Creation to complete.

### Step 2.3: Configure Supabase URLs and Keys

**👤 USER TASK - Get Project URL and API Keys:**

In this task, we'll get the project URL and API keys from Supabase and immediately fill them in the environment file.

---

#### 🌐 **Configure Environment Variables (`apps/web/.env.local`)**

1. **Get Project URL**
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** on the left sidebar
   - Then click on **Data API** in the sub-menu
   - Copy the **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefghij.supabase.co`)
   - **In your `apps/web/.env.local` file, immediately replace:**

```bash
SUPABASE_URL="https://abcdefghij.supabase.co"
```

2. **Get API Keys**
   - In the same **Project Settings** page, click on **API Keys** in the sub-menu
   - Copy the **anon public key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...`)
   - **In your `apps/web/.env.local` file, immediately replace:**

```bash
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

- Copy the **service_role key** (starts with `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...`)
- **In your `apps/web/.env.local` file, immediately replace:**

```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

3. **Get Database URL for Both Applications**

   - Click the **Connect** button in the top bar of your Supabase dashboard
   - In the "Connect to your project" modal, click on the **ORMs** tab
   - Select **Drizzle** from the dropdown
   - Copy the `DATABASE_URL` value from the code block shown

   **📋 IMPORTANT: Both applications use the same DATABASE_URL**

   - **In your web app's `apps/web/.env.local` file, update the DATABASE_URL:**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
```

- **In your competitor analysis agent's `apps/competitor-analysis-agent/.env.local` file, update the DATABASE_URL:**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
```

- You should see a `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` placeholder in your DATABASE_URL value.
- **Use the saved password:** Go to the top of your `apps/web/.env.local` file and copy the database password from the temporary comment line
- **Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in DATABASE_URL** with the password from your comment **in both environment files**
- Awesome! You've now configured the database connection for both applications.

---

**✅ Checkpoint:** You now have both applications configured with Supabase database connection

### Step 2.4: Configure Site URL and Redirect URLs

**👤 USER TASK - Configure Authentication Settings in Supabase:**

1. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**

   - In the Supabase platform, click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
   - Then click **"URL Configuration"** from the sub-menu
   - You should now see the URL configuration page

2. **Configure Site URL**

   - In the **Site URL** field, it should by default be set to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - If it's not, enter: `http://localhost:3000`
   - This tells Supabase where your application is running during development
   - Click **"Save"** to save this setting

3. **Add Redirect URLs**
   - Scroll down to the **Redirect URLs** section
   - Click **"Add URL"** button
   - Enter the following URL (make sure there are no spaces):

```bash
http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm
```

- Click **"Save"** to save this setting
- This URL handles email confirmations when users verify their accounts

💡 **Note**: The template handles email confirmations via `/auth/confirm` route only. No additional callback URLs are needed.

### Step 2.5: Customize Email Templates

**👤 USER TASK - Continue in Supabase Dashboard:**

**🔧 STILL IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Customize Email Templates**

1. **Navigate to Email Templates**

   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
   - Then click **"Email Templates"** from the sub-menu (you may see it listed as "Emails")
   - You should now see the email templates configuration page

2. **Review Email Templates**

   - You'll see several template tabs at the top of the page
   - The most important ones for this ADK Agent Simple application are **"Confirm signup"** and **"Reset password"
   - These templates control what emails users receive for account verification and password resets

3. **🛑 CHECKPOINT - Confirm Supabase Dashboard Configuration Complete**

   **Before proceeding to email template generation, please confirm you have completed all the Supabase dashboard steps:**

   - ✅ **Site URL** set to `http://localhost:3000`
   - ✅ **Redirect URL** added: `http://localhost:3000/auth/confirm`
   - ✅ **Email templates page** is now open in your browser

   **Are you ready to proceed with email template customization? The AI assistant will now generate custom email templates for your ADK Agent Simple application.**

4. **🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Generate Email Templates (Only After User Approval)**
   **You (the AI assistant) must now read these files before proceeding:**
   
   - Read `ai_docs/prep/app_name.md`
   - Read `ai_docs/prep/master_idea.md`
   - Read `ai_docs/prep/ui_theme.md`

   **After reading both files, generate the "Confirm signup" template using this prompt:**

   ```
   Based on the app_name.md, master_idea.md and ui_theme.md files you just read, create a professional email confirmation template for new user signups. Generate a copiable element for both:

   1. Subject line: "Confirm Your Signup to [App Name]"
   2. Simple HTML email with:
      - Brief welcome message
      - One simple button using {{ .ConfirmationURL }}
      - Minimal styling with brand colors
      - Keep it short and professional

   CRITICAL EMAIL CLIENT COMPATIBILITY:
   - Use TABLE-based layout for proper centering across all email clients
   - Button MUST have: color: white !important; text-decoration: none !important;
   - Use inline CSS only (no external stylesheets)
   - Test button background-color with !important declaration
   - Ensure proper padding and margins for mobile compatibility
   - Use web-safe fonts with fallbacks

   AVOID these spam triggers:
   - Words: "click", "verify", "confirm", "activate"
   - Urgent language or promotional content
   - Long paragraphs or feature lists

   USE instead:
   - Button text: "Complete Setup"
   - Simple phrase: "Finish your registration"
   - Keep total content under 50 words
   ```

   **Then generate the "Reset password" template using this prompt:**

   ```
   Following the same style as the "Confirm signup" template, create a simple password reset template. Generate both:

   1. Subject line: "Reset Your [App Name] Password"
   2. Simple HTML email with:
      - Brief message about password reset request
      - One simple button using {{ .ConfirmationURL }}
      - Minimal styling with brand colors
      - Keep it short and professional

   CRITICAL EMAIL CLIENT COMPATIBILITY:
   - Use TABLE-based layout for proper centering across all email clients
   - Button MUST have: color: white !important; text-decoration: none !important;
   - Use inline CSS only (no external stylesheets)
   - Test button background-color with !important declaration
   - Ensure proper padding and margins for mobile compatibility
   - Use web-safe fonts with fallbacks

   Button text: "Reset Password"
   Keep total content under 25 words
   ```

   **Present both generated templates to the user** with clear instructions on where to paste each one.

5. **👤 USER TASK - Apply Templates in Supabase Dashboard**

   **🔧 STILL IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Apply Generated Email Templates**

   💡 **Important:** The AI assistant will generate both complete email templates directly for you. Simply copy and paste them into the appropriate fields in your Supabase dashboard.

### Step 2.6: Database Schema Setup

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK:**

I'll now set up the database schema with all required tables for the ADK Agent Simple application. Let me run the database migrations:

**🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS VERIFY WORKING DIRECTORY FIRST** <!-- AI INTERNAL REFERENCE - DO NOT SHOW TO USER -->

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in the correct directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: If not in apps/web, change directory
cd apps/web

# STEP 3: Generate any pending migrations (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate
```

**First, generate down migrations before applying the schema:**

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Generate rollback migration:**

💡 **Note:** Ensure you read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md` before generating the down migration.

Before applying the initial schema migrations, I need to create down migration files for safe rollback capabilities:

1. **Identify the generated migration file:**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Find the most recent migration file (ONLY from apps/web directory)
ls -la drizzle/migrations/*.sql | tail -1
```

2. **Generate down migration using the template:**
   Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) analyze the migration file and create the corresponding down migration. This ensures we can safely rollback the schema changes if needed.

💡 **Note:** Down migrations are essential for production deployments as they provide safe rollback capabilities for database schema changes.

**Now apply the migrations:**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Run database migrations (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate

# STEP 3: Check migration status (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:status
```

**Expected Output of the migrations:**

```
🚀 Running migrations...
🔍 Checking rollback safety: 0 migration found
✅ All migrations have rollback files
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

### Step 2.7: Set Up User Creation Trigger

**🤖 AI ASSISTANT TASK - Set up the user trigger:**

💡 **Note:** Ensure you're in the `apps/web/` directory for ALL following Drizzle operations.

1. **Create User Trigger Migration**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Generate custom migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:generate:custom
```

2. **Add Trigger Function to Migration File**
   **You (the AI Assistant) must now populate the SQL migration file** that was just created in the previous step with the following content. This SQL creates the function and trigger.
   Open the generated migration file and add the following content:

```sql
-- Create the trigger function that handles new user creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
   INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, full_name, created_at, updated_at)
   VALUES (
      new.id,
      new.email,
      COALESCE(new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', ''),
      now(),
      now()
   );
   RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create the trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
   AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
   FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

3. **Generate Down Migration for User Trigger**
   Read the Drizzle Down Migration template located at `ai_docs/templates/drizzle_down_migration.md`, You (the AI Assistant) create the down migration for the user creation trigger:

```bash
# The down migration will include:
# - DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created;
# - DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();
```

4. **Apply the Trigger Migration**

```bash
# STEP 1: ALWAYS verify we're in apps/web directory
pwd
# Expected output: /path/to/project/apps/web

# STEP 2: Apply the trigger migration (ONLY from apps/web directory)
npm run db:migrate
```

**Expected Output:**

```
🚀 Running migrations...
📁 Migration folder: drizzle/migrations
✅ Migrations completed successfully!
🔌 Database connection closed
```

5. **👤 USER TASK - Verify Database Tables in Supabase**

   **🔧 BACK TO SUPABASE DASHBOARD - Verify Database Schema**

   - In your Supabase dashboard, click **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
   - You should now see the database tables page with the following tables created:
     - `users` - User profiles for authentication
     - `session_names` - Titles for ADK sessions

   💡 **If you don't see these tables:** The migrations may not have completed successfully. Check the terminal output for any errors. Ask the AI assistant to check the status of the migrations and fix any issues.

**💡 Key Features:** These database tables provide the foundation for user management and session tracking which are essential for the ADK Agent Simple application.

**📋 Additional ADK Tables:** When we later start the complete application stack in Phase 6, the ADK service (Python) will automatically create additional tables for agent functionality:

- `app_states` - ADK application state management
- `events` - ADK event tracking and processing
