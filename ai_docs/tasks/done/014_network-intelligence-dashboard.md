## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture

- **Frameworks & Versions:** Next.js 15.3, React 19, TypeScript 5.4 with strict mode
- **Database & ORM:** Supabase (Postgres) via Drizzle ORM for network data persistence
- **UI & Styling:** shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling and theming
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth managed by `middleware.ts` for protected routes
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Next.js App Router, Server Components for data fetching, Server Actions for mutations

### Current State

The current platform has basic portfolio tracking but lacks network intelligence. Fund and portfolio data structures exist but no relationship or network tracking. The existing component architecture provides a foundation for network visualization.

### Existing Context Providers Analysis

- **UserContext (`useUser()`):** Available throughout protected routes - provides user profile and authentication state
- **UsageContext (`useUsage()`):** Available in protected routes - handles subscription/billing data
- **Context Hierarchy:** Both providers available in protected route layouts
- **Available Context Hooks:** `useUser()`, `useUsage()` - network data not currently in context

**üîç Context Coverage Analysis:**

- Network intelligence data will need new context provider for relationship and network state
- No existing network data in current contexts
- Components will need to fetch network data via Server Components initially

### Data Migration Plan

- [ ] Create co_investors, co_investor_relationships, deal_flow, and portfolio_support_opportunities tables
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes for query performance and relationship traversals
- [ ] Add foreign key constraints and cascade deletes
- [ ] Validate data integrity after migration

### üö® MANDATORY: Down Migration Safety Protocol

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before running ANY database migration, you MUST create the corresponding down migration file following the `drizzle_down_migration.md` template process:

- [ ] **Step 1: Generate Migration** - Run `npm run db:generate` to create the migration file
- [ ] **Step 2: Create Down Migration** - Follow `drizzle_down_migration.md` template to analyze the migration and create the rollback file
- [ ] **Step 3: Create Subdirectory** - Create `drizzle/migrations/[timestamp_name]/` directory
- [ ] **Step 4: Generate down.sql** - Create the `down.sql` file with safe rollback operations
- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Safety** - Ensure all operations use `IF EXISTS` and include appropriate warnings
- [ ] **Step 6: Apply Migration** - Only after down migration is created, run `npm run db:migrate`

**üõë NEVER run `npm run db:migrate` without first creating the down migration file!**

---

## 8. API & Backend Changes

### Data Access Pattern - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULES

**üö® MANDATORY: Follow these rules strictly:**

#### **MUTATIONS (Server Actions)** ‚Üí `app/actions/[feature].ts`

- [ ] **Server Actions File** - `app/actions/network.ts` - ONLY mutations (add co-investor, update relationship, manage deal flow)
- [ ] Examples: `addCoInvestor()`, `updateRelationship()`, `addDealFlow()`, `createSupportOpportunity()`
- [ ] Must use `'use server'` directive and `revalidatePath()` after mutations

#### **QUERIES (Data Fetching)** ‚Üí Choose based on complexity:

- [ ] **Direct in Server Components** - Simple network queries for dashboard display
- [ ] **Query Functions in lib/network.ts** - Complex network analysis and relationship calculations

### Server Actions

- [ ] **`addCoInvestor`** - Create new co-investor profile with basic information
- [ ] **`updateCoInvestor`** - Update co-investor details and track record
- [ ] **`addRelationship`** - Establish relationship between co-investors
- [ ] **`addDealFlow`** - Add new investment opportunity to pipeline
- [ ] **`updateDealFlow`** - Update deal stage and evaluation progress

### Database Queries

- [ ] **Direct in Server Components** - Simple queries for co-investor lists and deal flow
- [ ] **Query Functions in lib/network.ts** - Complex network analysis, relationship strength calculations, and syndicate scoring

---

## 16. AI Agent Instructions

### Default Workflow - STRATEGIC ANALYSIS FIRST

üéØ **STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE:**
When a user requests any new feature, improvement, or significant change, your **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR** should be:

1. **EVALUATE STRATEGIC NEED** - Determine if multiple solutions exist or if it's straightforward
2. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS** (if needed) - Present solution options with pros/cons and get user direction
3. **CREATE A TASK DOCUMENT** in `ai_docs/` using this template
4. **GET USER APPROVAL** of the task document
5. **IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE** only after approval

**DO NOT:** Present implementation plans in chat without creating a proper task document first.
