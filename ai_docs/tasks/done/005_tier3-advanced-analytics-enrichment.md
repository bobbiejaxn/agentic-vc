## 2. Strategic Analysis & Solution Options

### When to Use Strategic Analysis

**‚úÖ CONDUCTING STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:**
- Multiple viable approaches for advanced analytics enrichment with different complexity levels
- Trade-offs between predictive accuracy vs implementation complexity
- Performance implications of sophisticated analytical models
- Cost considerations for advanced data sources and analytical tools
- Different enrichment strategies for various analytics categories (performance, competitive, network, predictive)

### Problem Context
The current Tier 3 extraction provides advanced analytics based solely on LLM analysis of document content, which creates fundamental limitations for sophisticated investment analysis. Advanced analytics require current market data, competitive benchmarks, predictive modeling, and network intelligence that cannot be derived from document content alone. Different analytics categories have vastly different enrichment requirements and data availability.

Based on lessons learned from document processing implementation, we understand that:

1. **Schema-first development is critical** - We must define advanced analytics schemas with proper validation before implementing predictive models
2. **Real-time subscriptions eliminate manual refreshing** - Complex analytics processing (60-90 seconds) must have progress tracking and status updates
3. **External API integration requires robust error handling** - Advanced analytics will depend on multiple data sources with varying reliability and cost structures
4. **Environment-driven feature tiers enable graceful degradation** - The system must provide value at basic analytics, selective enrichment, and full predictive modeling levels
5. **Component abstraction enables reusability** - Advanced analytics services must leverage foundations from Tasks 003 and 004 for cost optimization
6. **Progress tracking transforms user experience** - Users expect detailed feedback during complex analytical processing that can take 60-90 seconds
7. **Chunking strategies must balance context preservation with processing limits** - Selective analytics enrichment focuses on high-impact categories while managing computational complexity and API costs

### Solution Options Analysis

#### Option 1: Comprehensive Predictive Analytics Platform

- [ ] More sophisticated caching and analytical model management

**Implementation Complexity:** Very High - Complex state management, background analytics, progressive UI
**Risk Level:** Medium - Complexity mitigated by staged implementation

### Recommendation & Rationale

**üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:** Option 2 - Strategic Advanced Analytics with Selective Enrichment

**Why this is the best choice:**
1. **High Impact Focus:** Performance benchmarking, competitive positioning, and network intelligence provide immediate analytical value
2. **Manageable Complexity:** Focused scope makes implementation achievable without requiring data science team
3. **Cost Control:** Selective enrichment of high-value analytics categories provides good ROI
4. **Reasonable Performance:** 60-90 second processing time is acceptable for advanced analytics
5. **Scalable Foundation:** Can be extended to more sophisticated analytics later based on user feedback

**Key Decision Factors:**
- **Analytical Value:** Performance benchmarking and competitive positioning provide immediate investment insights
- **Implementation Feasibility:** Focused scope makes project achievable with available resources
- **Cost Predictability:** Clear cost structure based on targeted analytics enrichment
- **User Experience:** Comprehensive analytical insights without excessive processing delays
- **Business Impact:** Direct impact on investment decision quality and competitive intelligence

**Alternative Consideration:**
The Comprehensive approach (Option 1) would provide the most sophisticated analytics but requires significant investment in data science resources and external data subscriptions. The Progressive approach (Option 3) is technically elegant but adds complexity that may not be justified for current deployment scale.

### Decision Request

**üë§ USER DECISION REQUIRED:**
Based on this analysis, do you want to proceed with the recommended Strategic Advanced Analytics approach, or would you prefer a different strategy?

**Questions for you to consider:**
- Are performance benchmarking and competitive positioning the highest priority for your advanced analytics needs?
- How important are predictive modeling capabilities vs immediate analytical insights?
- Are you comfortable with some advanced analytics remaining document-only initially?
- What's your budget tolerance for external data subscriptions and analytical tools?

**Next Steps:**
Once you approve the strategic direction, I'll update the implementation plan and present you with next step options.

### Data Migration Plan
- [ ] [Migration step 1] Add advanced analytics fields to existing tier3Analytics table
- [ ] [Migration step 2] Add enrichment status tracking for advanced analytics
- [ ] [Migration step 3] Update existing documents with null analytics metadata for backward compatibility
- [ ] [Data validation steps] Verify enriched analytics structure matches existing consumption patterns

### üö® MANDATORY: Down Migration Safety Protocol
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before running ANY database migration, you MUST create the corresponding down migration file following the `drizzle_down_migration.md` template process:

- [ ] **Step 1: Generate Migration** - Run `npm run db:generate` to create the migration file
- [ ] **Step 2: Create Down Migration** - Follow `drizzle_down_migration.md` template to analyze the migration and create the rollback file
- [ ] **Step 3: Create Subdirectory** - Create `drizzle/migrations/[timestamp_name]/` directory
- [ ] **Step 4: Generate down.sql** - Create the `down.sql` file with safe rollback operations
- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Safety** - Ensure all operations use `IF EXISTS` and include appropriate warnings
- [ ] **Step 6: Apply Migration** - Only after down migration is created, run `npm run db:migrate`

**üõë NEVER run `npm run db:migrate` without first creating the down migration file!**

## 8. API & Backend Changes

### Data Access Pattern - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULES

**üö® MANDATORY: Follow these rules strictly:**

#### **MUTATIONS (Server Actions)** ‚Üí `convex/actions/[feature].ts`
- [ ] **Server Actions File** - `convex/actions/tier3Analytics.ts` - ONLY mutations (store enriched analytics, update analytics status)
- [ ] Examples: `enrichTier3Analytics()`, `updatePerformanceBenchmarking()`, `trackAnalyticsProgress()`
- [ ] Must use `'use server'` directive and proper error handling for complex analytics
- [ ] **What qualifies as mutations**: Storing enriched analytics, updating analytics status, analytical model management

#### **QUERIES (Data Fetching)** ‚Üí Choose based on complexity:

**Simple Queries** ‚Üí Direct in Server Components
- [ ] **Direct in Page Components** - Simple Tier 3 analytics retrieval with enrichment status
- [ ] Example: `const tier3Data = await db.select().from(tier3Analytics).where(eq(tier3Analytics.documentId, id))`
- [ ] Use when: Single table lookup, basic analytics status checking

**Complex Queries** ‚Üí `convex/lib/[feature].ts`
- [ ] **Query Functions in lib/** - `convex/lib/tier3Analytics.ts` for complex analytics logic
- [ ] Example: `calculatePerformanceBenchmarking()`, `analyzeCompetitivePositioning()`, `buildNetworkModels()`
- [ ] Use when: External API calls, complex analytical calculations, predictive modeling, data validation

#### **API Routes** ‚Üí `app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts` - **RARELY NEEDED**
üõë **Only create API routes for these specific cases:**
- [ ] **External API Proxies** - Not needed (all analytics enrichment server-side)
- [ ] **Non-HTML Responses** - Export functionality for analytics reports (if needed later)

‚ùå **DO NOT use API routes for:**
- [ ] ‚ùå Internal Tier 3 analytics data fetching (use lib/ functions instead)
- [ ] ‚ùå External API calls for analytics (use server actions instead)
- [ ] ‚ùå Analytics processing operations (use server actions instead)

#### **PROFESSIONAL NAMING (Directory-Based Separation):**
- `convex/actions/tier3Analytics.ts` - For Tier 3 analytics mutations only
- `convex/lib/tier3Analytics.ts` - For Tier 3 analytics logic and external data integration
- Example: `convex/actions/tier3Analytics.ts` + `convex/lib/tier3Analytics.ts` (no API route needed)

### Server Actions
<!-- New or modified server actions for mutations -->
- [ ] **`enrichTier3Analytics`** - Main analytics enrichment orchestrator for Tier 3
- [ ] **`benchmarkPerformance`** - Add market benchmarking to performance metrics
- [ ] **`analyzeCompetitivePositioning`** - Enrich competitive analysis with market intelligence
- [ ] **`expandNetworkIntelligence`** - Build network models with external relationship data
- [ ] **`generatePredictiveModels`** - Create predictive analytics using external data
- [ ] **`updateAnalyticsStatus`** - Track analytics enrichment progress and model accuracy

### Database Queries
<!-- How you'll fetch data - be explicit about the choice -->
- [ ] **Direct in Server Components** - Basic Tier 3 analytics lookup with enrichment status
- [ ] **Query Functions in lib/tier3Analytics/** - Complex analytics logic, external data integration, predictive modeling

### API Routes (Only for Special Cases)
<!-- üõë ONLY create API routes when Server Actions and lib/ functions cannot handle the use case -->
- [ ] **No API routes needed** - All Tier 3 analytics enrichment is server-side only

### External Integrations
<!-- Third-party APIs, services, etc. -->
- [Exa.ai API]: Market research, competitive intelligence, industry analysis
  - Use Cases: Market benchmarking, competitive positioning, industry trends
  - Rate Limit Management: Focused on high-value analytics categories
- [Firecrawl API]: Detailed company research, financial data extraction, competitive analysis
  - Use Cases: Deep competitive intelligence, performance benchmarking data
  - Rate Limit Management: Prioritized for key competitors and market leaders
- [Financial APIs]: Market data, index performance, economic indicators (if budget allows)
  - Use Cases: Real-time benchmarking, predictive model inputs
  - Rate Limit Management: Selective use for critical analytics only

**üö® MANDATORY: Use Latest AI Models**
- When using OpenAI models, use **gpt-4o-mini** for advanced analytics processing and insight synthesis
- External APIs (Exa, Firecrawl) as specified above with intelligent prioritization for advanced analytics

- [Advanced analytics cache] - Manage complex analytics caching and computation status

### üö® CRITICAL: Context Usage Strategy

**MANDATORY: Before creating any component props or planning data fetching, verify existing context availability**

#### Context-First Design Pattern
- [ ] **‚úÖ Check Available Contexts:** Document, Tier 2, and Tier 3 analytics context already available
- [ ] **‚úÖ Use Context Over Props:** Analytics enrichment status via existing Tier 3 analytics subscription
- [ ] **‚úÖ Avoid Prop Drilling:** Leverage existing real-time query patterns for enriched analytics data
- [ ] **‚úÖ Minimize Data Fetching:** Use existing Tier 3 analytics subscriptions
- [ ] **‚úÖ Context Provider Analysis:** Tier 3 analytics processing already provides base context

#### Decision Flowchart - "Should this be a prop or use context?"
```
üìä Do I need Tier 3 analytics enrichment data in my component?
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ üîç Is component already subscribing to Tier 3 analytics?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ YES: Extend existing subscription to include enrichment metadata
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚ùå NO: Create new subscription following existing Tier 3 patterns
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ üîÑ Is analytics enrichment metadata part of Tier 3 analytics?
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ YES: Use existing Tier 3 analytics context
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚ùå NO: Consider separate analytics enrichment context
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ üìù Is this analytics enrichment status only?
   ‚îú‚îÄ ‚úÖ YES: Use existing Tier 3 analytics subscription patterns
   ‚îî‚îÄ ‚ùå NO: Consider context for complex analytics metadata
```

#### Context Provider Mapping Strategy
**Before implementing any component:**
1. **Map existing Tier 3 subscriptions** - Which components already subscribe to Tier 3 data?
2. **Identify analytics enrichment extension points** - Where can enrichment metadata be added to existing subscriptions?
3. **Check for duplication** - Avoid separate analytics enrichment fetching when Tier 3 data already available
4. **Verify subscription patterns** - Use existing real-time query patterns for analytics enrichment status

#### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Component receives analytics data as props when already in Tier 3 context
interface AnalyticsProps {
  analytics: Tier3Data;           // This is in Tier 3 context!
  enrichment: AnalyticsEnrichment; // This can be part of Tier 3 context!
}

function AnalyticsComponent({ analytics, enrichment }: AnalyticsProps) {
  return <div>{analytics.metric}</div>;
}

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Component queries enriched Tier 3 analytics directly
function AnalyticsComponent() {
  const tier3Data = useQuery(api.tier3Analytics.get, { documentId });
  const analytics = tier3Data?.performanceMetrics[0]; // Includes enrichment metadata
  return <div>{analytics.metric}</div>;
}
```

#### Context Analysis Checklist
- [ ] **Scan existing Tier 3 analytics subscriptions** for enrichment extension opportunities

## 10. Code Changes Overview

### üö® MANDATORY: Always Show High-Level Code Changes Before Implementation

**AI Agent Instructions:** Before presenting the task document for approval, you MUST provide a clear overview of the code changes you're about to make. This helps the user understand exactly what will be modified without having to approve first.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] **Always include this section** for any task that modifies existing code
- [ ] **Show actual code snippets** with before/after comparisons
- [ ] **Focus on key changes** - don't show every line, but show enough to understand the transformation
- [ ] **Use file paths and line counts** to give context about scope of changes
- [ ] **Explain the impact** of each major change

### Format to Follow:

#### üìÇ **Current Implementation (Before)**
```typescript
// Current enhancedProcessing.ts - Tier 3 analytics without external enrichment
export const extractTier3Analytics = {
  args: { documentId: v.id("documents"), content: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const analyticsPrompt = `Extract advanced analytics from this document...`;
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: analyticsPrompt }],
    });

    const analyticsData = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content || "{}");

    await ctx.runMutation(internal.tier3Analytics.store, {
      documentId: args.documentId,
      performanceMetrics: analyticsData.performanceMetrics || [],
      competitiveAnalysis: analyticsData.competitiveAnalysis || [],
      networkIntelligence: analyticsData.networkIntelligence || [],
      predictiveModels: analyticsData.predictiveModels || [],
    });

    // No external benchmarking, competitive intelligence, or predictive modeling
  }
};
```

#### üìÇ **After Tier 3 Advanced Analytics Integration**
```typescript
// Enhanced enhancedProcessing.ts with strategic advanced analytics enrichment
export const extractTier3Analytics = {
  args: { documentId: v.id("documents"), content: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // 1. Extract base analytics from document
    const baseAnalytics = await extractBaseAdvancedAnalytics(args.content);

    // 2. Prioritize analytics enrichment targets
    const analyticsPlan = prioritizeAnalyticsEnrichment(baseAnalytics);

    // 3. Strategic enrichment - focus on high-impact analytics
    const enrichedAnalytics = await enrichHighImpactAnalytics(ctx, analyticsPlan);

    // 4. Combine LLM analytics with external enrichment
    const enhancedAnalytics = combineAdvancedAnalytics(baseAnalytics, enrichedAnalytics);

    // 5. Store with analytics enrichment metadata
    await ctx.runMutation(internal.tier3Analytics.storeEnriched, {
      documentId: args.documentId,
      analytics: enhancedAnalytics,
      enrichmentStatus: {
        totalEnriched: enrichedAnalytics.length,

        estimatedCost: calculateAnalyticsCost(enrichedAnalytics),
        modelAccuracy: calculateModelAccuracy(enrichedAnalytics),
        processedAt: Date.now(),
      }
    });
  }
};

// New tier3Analytics.ts - strategic advanced analytics logic
export const enrichHighImpactAnalytics = {
  args: { analyticsTargets: v.array(v.any()) },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const enrichedResults = [];

    // High priority: Performance benchmarking
    const performanceTargets = args.analyticsTargets.filter(t => t.type === 'performance');
    for (const target of performanceTargets) {
      const benchmarking = await calculatePerformanceBenchmarking(target);
      const marketComparison = await getMarketComparisons(target);
      enrichedResults.push({
        type: 'performance',
        original: target,
        benchmarking: { ...benchmarking, marketComparison },
      });
    }

    // High priority: Competitive positioning
    const competitiveTargets = args.analyticsTargets.filter(t => t.type === 'competitive');
    for (const target of competitiveTargets) {
      const positioning = await analyzeCompetitivePositioning(target);
      const marketIntelligence = await getMarketIntelligence(target);

        type: 'competitive',
        original: target,
        marketIntelligence: { ...positioning, marketIntelligence },
      });
    }

    // High priority: Network intelligence expansion
    const networkTargets = args.analyticsTargets.filter(t => t.type === 'network');
    for (const target of networkTargets) {

      enrichedResults.push({
        type: 'network',
        original: target,
        networkExpansion,
      });
    }

    // Selective: Predictive modeling (if sufficient data quality)
    const predictiveTargets = args.analyticsTargets.filter(t =>
      t.type === 'predictive' && t.dataQuality === 'high'
    );
    for (const target of predictiveTargets.slice(0, 2)) { // Limit for cost control
      const models = await generatePredictiveModels(target);
      enrichedResults.push({
        type: 'predictive',
        original: target,
        modelValidation: models,
      });

- [ ] **Add brief completion notes** (file paths, key changes, etc.)
- [ ] **This serves multiple purposes:**
  - [ ] **Forces verification** - You must confirm you actually did what you said
  - [ ] **Provides user visibility** - Clear progress tracking throughout implementation
  - [ ] **Prevents skipped steps** - Systematic approach ensures nothing is missed
  - [ ] **Creates audit trail** - Documentation of what was actually completed
  - [ ] **Enables better debugging** - If issues arise, easy to see what was changed

```

**File Organization Rules:**
- **Components**: Always in `components/[feature]/` directories
- **Server Actions**: In `convex/actions/[feature].ts` files (mutations only)
- **Complex Queries**: In `convex/lib/[feature].ts` files (when needed)
- **Pages**: Route-level components in `src/pages/`
- **Database**: Schema updates in `convex/schema.ts`, migrations in `drizzle/migrations/`

#### **LIB FILE SERVER/CLIENT SEPARATION - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULE**

**üö® MANDATORY: Prevent Server/Client Boundary Violations**

When creating lib files, **NEVER mix server-only imports with client-safe utilities** in the same file.

**Server-Only Imports (Cannot be used by client components):**
- Advanced analytics calculation libraries
- External APIs (Exa.ai, Firecrawl) for analytics enrichment
- `@/lib/externalEnrichment` (from Task 003)
- Server Actions or other server-side functions
- Database operations for Tier 3 analytics

**Decision Flowchart - "Should I split this lib file?"**
```
üìÅ What's in your convex/lib/tier3Analytics.ts file?
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ üî¥ Server-only imports + Client-safe utilities?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úÖ SPLIT: No client components need advanced analytics logic
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ üü¢ Only server-side operations?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úÖ KEEP: Single convex/lib/tier3Analytics.ts file (server-only)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ üü¢ Only client-safe utilities?
   ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úÖ KEEP: Single file (not applicable for advanced analytics)
```

**File Naming Pattern:**
- `convex/lib/tier3Analytics.ts` - Server-side advanced analytics operations only
- No client-side files needed for Tier 3 analytics (all server-side)

### Files to Modify
- [ ] **`convex/schema.ts`** - Add advanced analytics fields to Tier 3 analytics tables
- [ ] **`convex/enhancedProcessing.ts`** - Integrate strategic analytics enrichment
- [ ] **`src/pages/Tier3IntelligencePage.tsx`** - Add advanced analytics visualization
- [ ] **`src/components/tier3/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`** - Enhance with enriched analytics display

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Dependencies already added in Task 003 (exa-js, @firecrawl/firecrawl)
    // Chart libraries for advanced analytics visualization (if needed)
    "recharts": "^2.8.0",  // For performance and competitive charts
    "d3": "^7.8.0",       // For network intelligence visualization (optional)
  }
}
```

  - **Recommendation:** Graceful handling of network visualization with limited connectivity
- [ ] **Edge Case 3: Rapid market changes making analytics outdated**
  - **Analysis Approach:** Review data freshness indicators and refresh strategies
  - **Recommendation:** Real-time data freshness tracking and user notifications

### Security & Access Control Review
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics Privacy:** Does sophisticated analytics reveal sensitive competitive intelligence?
  - **Check:** All analytics based on publicly available data, no private document content shared externally
- [ ] **Model Security:** Are predictive models and analytical algorithms properly secured?
  - **Check:** Server-side only processing, no model exposure to client
- [ ] **Data Aggregation Security:** Are aggregated analytics properly secured and anonymized?
  - **Check:** Analytics data inherits same security as original Tier 3 analytics
- [ ] **Computational Resource Protection:** Are complex analytics protected against resource abuse?
  - **Check:** Rate limiting, cost controls, and computational resource management

### AI Agent Analysis Approach
**Focus:** Review advanced analytics code to identify potential failure points and security gaps. When issues are found, provide specific recommendations with file paths and code examples.

**Priority Order:**
1. **Critical:** Predictive model accuracy and validation
2. **Important:** Performance benchmarking data quality and reliability
3. **Nice-to-have:** Advanced visualization and user experience optimization

### What Constitutes "Explicit User Approval"

#### For Strategic Analysis
**‚úÖ STRATEGIC APPROVAL RESPONSES (Proceed to task document creation):**
- "Strategic advanced analytics looks good"
- "Go with performance benchmarking and competitive intelligence focus"
- "I prefer the focused analytics approach"
- "Proceed with strategic analytics enrichment"
- "That approach works"
- "Yes, use that strategy"

#### For Implementation Options (A/B/C Choice)
**‚úÖ OPTION A RESPONSES (Show detailed code previews):**
- "A" or "Option A"
- "Preview the changes"
- "Show me the code changes"
- "Let me see what will be modified"
- "Walk me through the changes"

**‚úÖ OPTION B RESPONSES (Start implementation immediately):**
- "B" or "Option B"
- "Proceed" or "Go ahead"
- "Approved" or "Start implementation"
- "Begin" or "Execute the plan"
- "Looks good, implement it"

**‚úÖ OPTION C RESPONSES (Provide more feedback):**
- "C" or "Option C"
- "I have questions about..."
- "Can you modify..."
- "What about..." or "How will you handle..."
- "I'd like to change..."
- "Wait, let me think about..."

#### For Phase Continuation
**‚úÖ PHASE CONTINUATION RESPONSES:**
- "proceed"
- "continue"
- "next phase"
- "go ahead"
- "looks good"

**‚ùì CLARIFICATION NEEDED (Do NOT continue to next phase):**
- Questions about the completed phase
- Requests for changes to completed work
- Concerns about the implementation
- No response or silence

#### For Final Code Review
**‚úÖ CODE REVIEW APPROVAL:**
- "proceed"
- "yes, review the code"
- "go ahead with review"
- "approved"

üõë **NEVER start coding without explicit A/B/C choice from user!**
üõë **NEVER continue to next phase without "proceed" confirmation!**
üõë **NEVER skip comprehensive code review after implementation phases!**
üõë **NEVER proceed to user testing without completing code review first!**
üõë **NEVER run `npm run db:migrate` without first creating the down migration file using `drizzle_down_migration.md` template!**
üõë **NEVER run application execution commands - user already has app running!**

### üö® CRITICAL: Command Execution Rules
**NEVER run application execution commands - the user already has their development environment running!**

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN COMMANDS (Will cause conflicts with running dev server):**
- `npm run dev` / `npm start` / `next dev` - User already running
- `npm run build` / `next build` - Expensive and unnecessary for validation
- Any command that starts/serves the application
- Any command that compiles/builds for production
- Any long-running processes or servers

**‚úÖ ALLOWED COMMANDS (Safe static analysis only):**
- `npm run lint` - Static code analysis, safe to run
- `npm run type-check` / `tsc --noEmit` - Type checking only, no compilation
- Database commands (when explicitly needed): `npm run db:generate`, `npm run db:migrate`
- File reading/analysis tools

**üéØ VALIDATION STRATEGY:**
- Use linting for code quality issues
- Read files to verify logic and structure
- Check syntax and dependencies statically
- Let the user handle all application testing manually

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Follow TypeScript best practices
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Write Professional Comments - Never Historical Comments**
  - [ ] **‚ùå NEVER write change history**: "Fixed this", "Removed function", "Updated to use new API"
  - [ ] **‚ùå NEVER write migration artifacts**: "Moved from X", "Previously was Y"
  - [ ] **‚úÖ ALWAYS explain business logic**: "Calculate performance benchmarking against market indices", "Generate competitive intelligence using external market data"
  - [ ] **‚úÖ Write for future developers** - explain what/why the code does what it does, not what you changed
  - [ ] **Remove unused code completely** - don't leave comments explaining what was removed
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Use early returns to keep code clean and readable**
  - [ ] **Prioritize early returns** over nested if-else statements
  - [ ] **Validate inputs early** and return immediately for invalid cases
  - [ ] **Handle error conditions first** before proceeding with main logic
  - [ ] **Exit early for edge cases** to reduce nesting and improve readability
  - [ ] **Example pattern**: `if (invalid) return error; // main logic here`
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Use async/await instead of .then() chaining**
  - [ ] **Avoid Promise .then() chains** - use async/await for better readability
  - [ ] **Use try/catch blocks** for error handling instead of .catch() chaining
  - [ ] **Use Promise.all()** for concurrent operations instead of chaining multiple .then()
  - [ ] **Create separate async functions** for complex operations instead of long chains
  - [ ] **Example**: `const result = await operation();` instead of `operation().then(result => ...)`
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: NO FALLBACK BEHAVIOR - Always throw errors instead**
  - [ ] **Never handle "legacy formats"** - expect the current format or fail fast
  - [ ] **No "try other common fields"** fallback logic - if expected field missing, throw error
  - [ ] **Fail fast and clearly** - don't mask issues with fallback behavior
  - [ ] **Single expected response format** - based on current API contract
  - [ ] **Throw descriptive errors** - explain exactly what format was expected vs received
  - [ ] **Example**: `if (!expectedFormat) throw new Error('Expected X format, got Y');`
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Create down migration files before running ANY database migration**
  - [ ] Follow `drizzle_down_migration.md` template process
  - [ ] Use `IF EXISTS` clauses for safe rollback operations
  - [ ] Include appropriate warnings for data loss risks
- [ ] **Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints)**
- [ ] **Test components in both light and dark mode**
- [ ] **Verify mobile usability on devices 320px width and up**
- [ ] Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Use semantic HTML elements
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Clean up removal artifacts**
  - [ ] **Never leave placeholder comments** like "// No predictive models needed" or "// Removed for cost"
  - [ ] **Delete empty functions/components** completely rather than leaving commented stubs
  - [ ] **Remove unused imports** and dependencies after deletions
  - [ ] **Clean up empty interfaces/types** that no longer serve a purpose
  - [ ] **Remove dead code paths** rather than commenting them out
  - [ ] **If removing code, remove it completely** - don't leave explanatory comments about what was removed

### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] **‚úÖ VERIFY: Used correct data access pattern**
  - [ ] Mutations ‚Üí Server Actions (`convex/actions/[feature].ts`)
  - [ ] Queries ‚Üí lib functions (`convex/lib/[feature].ts`) for complex, direct in components for simple
  - [ ] API routes ‚Üí Only for webhooks, file exports, external integrations
- [ ] **üö® VERIFY: No server/client boundary violations in lib files**
  - [ ] Files with server imports (external APIs, database operations) don't export client-safe utilities
  - [ ] Client components can import utilities without pulling in server dependencies
  - [ ] Mixed server/client files are split using `-client.ts` pattern
- [ ] **üö® VERIFY: Proper context usage patterns**
  - [ ] Components use existing Tier 3 analytics subscription patterns instead of unnecessary props
  - [ ] No duplicate data fetching when analytics enrichment data is available via existing subscriptions
  - [ ] Real-time subscription hooks used appropriately for analytics enrichment status tracking
  - [ ] No prop drilling when subscription alternative exists for the same data
  - [ ] All analytics enrichment data access follows existing Convex query patterns
- [ ] **‚ùå AVOID: Creating unnecessary API routes for internal operations**
- [ ] **‚ùå AVOID: Mixing server-only imports with client-safe utilities in same file**
- [ ] **‚ùå AVOID: Prop drilling when existing subscription patterns provide the needed data**
- [ ] **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Does this really need an API route or should it be a Server Action/lib function?**
- [ ] **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Can Tier 3 analytics enrichment be handled entirely server-side?**
- [ ] **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Are analytics enrichment status updates using existing real-time subscription patterns?**
