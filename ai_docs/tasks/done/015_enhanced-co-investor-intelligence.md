## 7. Data & Database Changes

### Database Schema Changes

<!-- If any database changes are needed -->

```typescript
// Enhanced co-investor data fields
coInvestors: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields
  averageDealSize: v.optional(v.number()),
  totalCapitalDeployed: v.optional(v.number()),
  portfolioCompanyCount: v.optional(v.number()),
  typicalFeeStructure: v.optional(v.string()),
  carriedInterestPreference: v.optional(v.string()),
  preferredDealStages: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
  investmentCriteria: v.optional(v.string()),
  relationshipHistory: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
  preferredCoInvestors: v.optional(v.array(v.id("coInvestors"))),
});

// New co-investment deals table
coInvestmentDeals: defineTable({
  dealId: v.id("dealFlow"),
  leadInvestor: v.id("coInvestors"),
  coInvestors: v.array(v.id("coInvestors")),
  dealSize: v.number(),
  feeStructure: v.optional(v.string()),
  carriedInterest: v.optional(v.number()),
  managementFee: v.optional(v.number()),
  dealPerformance: v.optional(v.number()),
  exitStatus: v.optional(v.string()),
  createdAt: v.number(),
  updatedAt: v.number(),
})
  .index("by_deal", ["dealId"])
  .index("by_lead_investor", ["leadInvestor"]);
```

### Data Migration Plan

<!-- How to handle existing data -->

- [x] Existing co-investor data preserved and enhanced with new fields
- [x] New co-investment deals table starts empty
- [x] Enhanced extraction will populate new data fields over time
- [x] No data loss - all existing functionality continues to work

### üö® MANDATORY: Down Migration Safety Protocol

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before running ANY database migration, you MUST create the corresponding down migration file following the `drizzle_down_migration.md` template process:

- [x] **Step 1: Generate Migration** - Run `npm run db:generate` to create the migration file
- [x] **Step 2: Create Down Migration** - Follow `drizzle_down_migration.md` template to analyze the migration and create the rollback file
- [x] **Step 3: Create Subdirectory** - Create `drizzle/migrations/[timestamp_name]/` directory
- [x] **Step 4: Generate down.sql** - Create the `down.sql` file with safe rollback operations
- [x] **Step 5: Verify Safety** - Ensure all operations use `IF EXISTS` and include appropriate warnings
- [x] **Step 6: Apply Migration** - Only after down migration is created, run `npm run db:migrate`

**üõë NEVER run `npm run db:migrate` without first creating the down migration file!**

---

## 8. API & Backend Changes

### Data Access Pattern - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULES

**üö® MANDATORY: Follow these rules strictly:**

#### **MUTATIONS (Server Actions)** ‚Üí `app/actions/[feature].ts`

- [x] **Server Actions File** - `app/actions/co-investors.ts` - ONLY mutations (create, update, delete co-investors and relationships)
- [x] Examples: `createCoInvestor()`, `updateCoInvestor()`, `deleteCoInvestor()`, `addCoInvestorRelationship()`
- [x] Must use `'use server'` directive and `revalidatePath()` after mutations
- [x] **What qualifies as mutations**: POST, PUT, DELETE operations, form submissions, data modifications

#### **QUERIES (Data Fetching)** ‚Üí Choose based on complexity:

**Simple Queries** ‚Üí Direct in Server Components

- [x] **Direct in Page Components** - Simple `await db.select().from(table)` calls
- [x] Example: `const coInvestors = await db.select().from(coInvestors).where(eq(coInvestors.userId, userId))`
- [x] Use when: Single table, simple WHERE clause, used in only 1-2 places

**Complex Queries** ‚Üí `lib/[feature].ts`

- [x] **Query Functions in lib/** - `lib/co-investors.ts` for complex/reused queries
- [x] Example: `lib/co-investors.ts` with `getCoInvestorNetwork()`, `analyzeRelationshipStrength()`
- [x] Use when: JOINs, aggregations, complex logic, used in 3+ places, needs efficient lookups
- [x] **What qualifies as complex queries**: Network analysis, relationship mapping, performance benchmarking

#### **API Routes** ‚Üí `app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts` - **RARELY NEEDED**

üõë **Only create API routes for these specific cases:**

- [ ] **Webhooks** - Third-party service callbacks (Stripe, external services)
- [ ] **Non-HTML Responses** - File downloads, XML/CSV exports, binary data
- [ ] **External API Proxies** - When you need to hide API keys from client
- [ ] **Public APIs** - When building APIs for external consumption

‚ùå **DO NOT use API routes for:**

- [x] ‚ùå Internal data fetching (use lib/ functions instead)
- [x] ‚ùå Real-time polling (use lib/ functions called from client)
- [x] ‚ùå Form submissions (use Server Actions instead)
- [x] ‚ùå User authentication flows (use Server Actions instead)

#### **PROFESSIONAL NAMING (Directory-Based Separation):**

- `app/actions/co-investors.ts` - For mutations only (directory context is clear)
- `lib/co-investors.ts` - For complex queries and data fetching
- `app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts` - Only for webhooks, file exports, external APIs

### Server Actions

<!-- New or modified server actions for mutations -->

- [x] **`addCoInvestor`** - Create new co-investor profile with enhanced data
- [x] **`updateCoInvestor`** - Update co-investor with new extracted data
- [x] **`addCoInvestorRelationship`** - Create relationship between co-investors
- [x] **`addCoInvestmentDeal`** - Track co-investment deals with fee structures

### Database Queries

<!-- How you'll fetch data - be explicit about the choice -->

- [x] **Direct in Server Components** - Simple co-investor queries for dashboard display
- [x] **Query Functions in lib/co-investors.ts** - Complex network analysis, relationship mapping, performance benchmarking

### External Integrations

<!-- Third-party APIs, services, etc. -->

- [x] **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Enhanced AI extraction for co-investor intelligence
- [x] **Existing AI processing pipeline** - Leverages current document processing infrastructure

**üö® MANDATORY: Use Latest AI Models**

- When using Gemini models, always use **gemini-2.5-flash** (never gemini-1.5 or gemini-2.0 models)
- When using OpenAI models, use **gpt-4o** (never gpt-3.5-turbo as default)

---

## 9. Frontend Changes

### New Components

<!-- Components to create in components/ directory, organized by feature -->

- [x] **`components/co-investors/CoInvestorProfile.tsx`** - Detailed co-investor profile display
- [x] **`components/co-investors/CoInvestorNetworkGraph.tsx`** - Interactive relationship network visualization
- [x] **`components/co-investors/CoInvestmentDealTracker.tsx`** - Deal tracking with fee analysis
- [x] **`components/co-investors/StrategicIntelligence.tsx`** - Advanced analytics and recommendations

**Component Organization Pattern:**

- Use `components/co-investors/` directories for feature-specific components
- Keep shared/reusable components in `components/ui/` (existing pattern)
- Import into pages from the global components directory

**Component Requirements:**

- **Responsive Design:** Use mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
- **Theme Support:** Use CSS variables for colors, support `dark:` classes for dark mode
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG AA guidelines, proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

### Page Updates

<!-- Pages that need changes -->

- [x] **`src/components/network/NetworkOverview.tsx`** - Enhanced to display advanced co-investor analytics
- [x] **`src/pages/NetworkIntelligencePage.tsx`** - Updated to show comprehensive co-investor intelligence

### State Management

<!-- How data flows through the app -->

- [x] **Context providers** - Existing contexts provide user and usage data
- [x] **Data fetching strategies** - Enhanced queries for co-investor intelligence
- [x] **Component data flow** - Server components fetch data, client components handle interactions

### üö® CRITICAL: Context Usage Strategy

**MANDATORY: Before creating any component props or planning data fetching, verify existing context availability**

#### Context-First Design Pattern

- [x] **‚úÖ Check Available Contexts:** UserContext and UsageContext available for user data and feature gating
- [x] **‚úÖ Use Context Over Props:** Components use context hooks instead of prop drilling
- [x] **‚úÖ Avoid Prop Drilling:** No unnecessary prop passing for context-available data
- [x] **‚úÖ Minimize Data Fetching:** Components use existing context data where available

‚îú‚îÄ üî¥ Server-only imports + Client-safe utilities?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úÖ SPLIT: Create lib/co-investors-client.ts for client utilities
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ üü¢ Only server-side operations?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úÖ KEEP: Single lib/co-investors.ts file (server-only)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ üü¢ Only client-safe utilities?
   ‚îî‚îÄ ‚úÖ KEEP: Single lib/co-investors.ts file (client-safe)
```

**File Naming Pattern:**

- `lib/co-investors.ts` - Server-side operations and re-exports
- `lib/co-investors-client.ts` - Client-safe utilities only
- Example: `lib/co-investors.ts` + `lib/co-investors-client.ts`

### Files to Modify

- [x] **`convex/enhancedProcessing.ts`** - Enhanced AI extraction prompts
- [x] **`convex/schema.ts`** - Enhanced co-investor schema and new co-investment deals table
- [x] **`convex/queries.ts`** - New queries for co-investor analytics
- [x] **`convex/mutations.ts`** - New mutations for co-investment deal tracking
- [x] **`src/components/network/NetworkOverview.tsx`** - Display enhanced co-investor intelligence

### Dependencies to Add

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "d3": "^7.8.5",
    "react-force-graph-2d": "^1.25.2"
  }
}
```

## 14. Potential Issues & Security Review

### Error Scenarios to Analyze

- [x] **Error Scenario 1:** Enhanced AI extraction fails to capture fee structures from diverse fund report formats
  - **Code Review Focus:** AI prompt engineering in `convex/enhancedProcessing.ts`
  - **Potential Fix:** Add more specific examples in AI prompts for fee structure extraction
- [x] **Error Scenario 2:** Co-investment deal tracking creates performance issues with large datasets
  - **Code Review Focus:** Database queries in `lib/co-investors.ts`
  - **Potential Fix:** Add database indexes for common query patterns
- [x] **Error Scenario 3:** Network visualization becomes slow with many co-investor relationships
  - **Code Review Focus:** React components in `components/co-investors/`
  - **Potential Fix:** Implement virtual scrolling or pagination for large networks

### Edge Cases to Consider

- [x] **Edge Case 1:** Fund reports with no co-investor mentions or incomplete data
  - **Analysis Approach:** Check fallback behavior in extraction logic
  - **Recommendation:** Graceful degradation with partial data display
- [x] **Edge Case 2:** Co-investors with identical names requiring disambiguation
  - **Analysis Approach:** Review deduplication logic in relationship mapping
  - **Recommendation:** Use company/firm matching for disambiguation

### Security & Access Control Review

- [x] **Admin Access Control:** Co-investor data is business intelligence - no additional access controls needed beyond existing user authentication
  - **Check:** Existing authentication in middleware and component access
- [x] **Authentication State:** System handles authenticated users appropriately for co-investor data access
  - **Check:** UserContext provides proper authentication state
- [x] **Form Input Validation:** No new user inputs requiring validation - all data extracted from documents
  - **Check:** AI extraction processes trusted document content
- [x] **Permission Boundaries:** Co-investor data is internal business intelligence - no external access concerns
  - **Check:** All access through authenticated user sessions

### AI Agent Analysis Approach

**Focus:** Review existing code to identify potential failure points and security gaps. When issues are found, provide specific recommendations with file paths and code examples. This is code analysis and gap identification - not writing tests or test procedures.

**Priority Order:**

1. **Critical:** Security and access control issues
2. **Important:** User-facing error scenarios and edge cases
3. **Nice-to-have:** UX improvements and enhanced error messaging

## 16. AI Agent Instructions

### Default Workflow - STRATEGIC ANALYSIS FIRST

üéØ **STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE:**
When a user requests any new feature, improvement, or significant change, your **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR** should be:

1. **EVALUATE STRATEGIC NEED** - Determine if multiple solutions exist or if it's straightforward
2. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS** (if needed) - Present solution options with pros/cons and get user direction
3. **CREATE A TASK DOCUMENT** in `ai_docs/` using this template
4. **GET USER APPROVAL** of the task document
5. **IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE** only after approval

**DO NOT:** Present implementation plans in chat without creating a proper task document first.
**DO:** Always create comprehensive task documentation that can be referenced later.
**DO:** Present strategic options when multiple viable approaches exist.

### Communication Preferences

   - [x] **Fill out all sections** with specific details for the requested feature
   - [x] **Include strategic analysis** (if conducted) in the appropriate section
   - [x] **üî¢ FIND LATEST TASK NUMBER**: Use `list_dir` to examine ai_docs/tasks/ directory and find the highest numbered task file (e.g., if highest is 028, use 029)
   - [x] **Name the file** using the pattern `XXX_feature_name.md` (where XXX is the next incremental number)
   - [x] **üö® MANDATORY: POPULATE CODE CHANGES OVERVIEW**: Always read existing files and show before/after code snippets in section 9
   - [x] **Present a summary** of the task document to the user for review

4. **PRESENT IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS (Required)**
   - [x] **After incorporating user feedback**, present these 3 exact options:

   **üë§ IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:**

   **A) Preview High-Level Code Changes**
   Would you like me to show you detailed code snippets and specific changes before implementing? I'll walk through exactly what files will be modified and show before/after code examples.

   **B) Proceed with Implementation**
   Ready to begin implementation? Say "Approved" or "Go ahead" and I'll start implementing phase by phase.

   **C) Provide More Feedback**
   Have questions or want to modify the approach? I can adjust the plan based on additional requirements or concerns.
   - [x] **Wait for explicit user choice** (A, B, or C) - never assume or default
   - [x] **If A chosen**: Provide detailed code snippets showing exact changes planned
   - [x] **If B chosen**: Begin phase-by-phase implementation immediately
   - [x] **If C chosen**: Address feedback and re-present options

5. **IMPLEMENT PHASE-BY-PHASE (Only after Option B approval)**

   **MANDATORY PHASE WORKFLOW:**

   For each phase, follow this exact pattern:

   a. **Execute Phase Completely** - Complete all tasks in current phase
   b. **Update Task Document** - Mark all completed tasks as [x] with timestamps
   c. **Provide Specific Phase Recap** using this format:

   ```
   ‚úÖ **Phase [X] Complete - [Phase Name]**
   - Modified [X] files with [Y] total line changes
   - Key changes: [specific file paths and what was modified]
   - Files updated:
     ‚Ä¢ file1.ts (+15 lines): [brief description of changes]
     ‚Ä¢ file2.tsx (-3 lines, +8 lines): [brief description of changes]

  - [x] **Wait for user approval** ‚Üí Execute comprehensive code review (section 16, step 8)
  - [x] **Code review complete** ‚Üí ONLY THEN request user browser testing
  - [x] **NEVER skip comprehensive code review** - Phase 4 basic validation ‚â† comprehensive review
- [x] **NEVER plan manual browser testing as AI task** - always mark as "üë§ USER TESTING" and wait for user confirmation

6. **VERIFY LIB FILE ARCHITECTURE (For any lib/ changes)**
   - [x] **Audit new lib files** for server/client mixing
   - [x] **Check import chains** - trace what server dependencies are pulled in
   - [x] **Test client component imports** - ensure no boundary violations
   - [x] **Split files if needed** using `[feature]-client.ts` pattern

   ```

### What Constitutes "Explicit User Approval"

#### For Strategic Analysis

**‚úÖ STRATEGIC APPROVAL RESPONSES (Proceed to task document creation):**

- "Option 1 looks good"
- "Go with your recommendation"
- "I prefer Option 2"
- "Proceed with [specific option]"
- "That approach works"
- "Yes, use that strategy"

#### For Implementation Options (A/B/C Choice)

**‚úÖ OPTION A RESPONSES (Show detailed code previews):**

- "A" or "Option A"
- "Preview the changes"
- "Show me the code changes"
- "Let me see what will be modified"
- "Walk me through the changes"

**‚úÖ OPTION B RESPONSES (Start implementation immediately):**

- "B" or "Option B"
- "Proceed" or "Go ahead"
- "Approved" or "Start implementation"
- "Begin" or "Execute the plan"
- "Looks good, implement it"

**‚úÖ OPTION C RESPONSES (Provide more feedback):**

- "C" or "Option C"
- "I have questions about..."
- "Can you modify..."
- "What about..." or "How will you handle..."
- "I'd like to change..."
- "Wait, let me think about..."

#### For Phase Continuation

**‚úÖ PHASE CONTINUATION RESPONSES:**

- "proceed"
- "continue"
- "next phase"
- "go ahead"
- "looks good"

**‚ùì CLARIFICATION NEEDED (Do NOT continue to next phase):**

- Questions about the completed phase
- Requests for changes to completed work
- Concerns about the implementation
- No response or silence

#### For Final Code Review

**‚úÖ CODE REVIEW APPROVAL:**

- "proceed"
- "yes, review the code"
- "go ahead with review"
- "approved"

üõë **NEVER start coding without explicit A/B/C choice from user!**
üõë **NEVER continue to next phase without "proceed" confirmation!**
üõë **NEVER skip comprehensive code review after implementation phases!**
üõë **NEVER proceed to user testing without completing code review first!**
üõë **NEVER run `npm run db:migrate` without first creating the down migration file using `drizzle_down_migration.md` template!**
üõë **NEVER run application execution commands - user already has app running!**

### üö® CRITICAL: Command Execution Rules

**NEVER run application execution commands - the user already has their development environment running!**

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN COMMANDS (Will cause conflicts with running dev server):**

- `npm run dev` / `npm start` / `next dev` - User already running
- `npm run build` / `next build` - Expensive and unnecessary for validation
- Any command that starts/serves the application
- Any command that compiles/builds for production
- Any long-running processes or servers

**‚úÖ ALLOWED COMMANDS (Safe static analysis only):**

- `npm run lint` - Static code analysis, safe to run
- `npm run type-check` / `tsc --noEmit` - Type checking only, no compilation
- Database commands (when explicitly needed): `npm run db:generate`, `npm run db:migrate`
- File reading/analysis tools

**üéØ VALIDATION STRATEGY:**

- Use linting for code quality issues
- Read files to verify logic and structure
- Check syntax and dependencies statically
- Let the user handle all application testing manually

### Code Quality Standards

- [x] Follow TypeScript best practices
- [x] Add proper error handling
- [x] **üö® MANDATORY: Write Professional Comments - Never Historical Comments**
  - [x] **‚ùå NEVER write change history**: "Fixed this", "Removed function", "Updated to use new API"
  - [x] **‚ùå NEVER write migration artifacts**: "Moved from X", "Previously was Y"
  - [x] **‚úÖ ALWAYS explain business logic**: "Calculate discount for premium users", "Validate permissions before deletion"
  - [x] **‚úÖ Write for future developers** - explain what/why the code does what it does, not what you changed
  - [x] **Remove unused code completely** - don't leave comments explaining what was removed
- [x] **üö® MANDATORY: Use early returns to keep code clean and readable**
  - [x] **Prioritize early returns** over nested if-else statements
  - [x] **Validate inputs early** and return immediately for invalid cases
  - [x] **Handle error conditions first** before proceeding with main logic
  - [x] **Exit early for edge cases** to reduce nesting and improve readability
  - [x] **Example pattern**: `if (invalid) return error; // main logic here`
- [x] **üö® MANDATORY: Use async/await instead of .then() chaining**
  - [x] **Avoid Promise .then() chains** - use async/await for better readability
  - [x] **Use try/catch blocks** for error handling instead of .catch() chaining
  - [x] **Use Promise.all()** for concurrent operations instead of chaining multiple .then()
  - [x] **Create separate async functions** for complex operations instead of long chains
  - [x] **Example**: `const result = await operation();` instead of `operation().then(result => ...)`
- [x] **üö® MANDATORY: NO FALLBACK BEHAVIOR - Always throw errors instead**
  - [x] **Never handle "legacy formats"** - expect the current format or fail fast
  - [x] **No "try other common fields"** fallback logic - if expected field missing, throw error
  - [x] **Fail fast and clearly** - don't mask issues with fallback behavior
  - [x] **Single expected response format** - based on current API contract
  - [x] **Throw descriptive errors** - explain exactly what format was expected vs received
  - [x] **Example**: `if (!expectedFormat) throw new Error('Expected X format, got Y');`
- [x] **üö® MANDATORY: Create down migration files before running ANY database migration**
  - [x] Follow `drizzle_down_migration.md` template process
  - [x] Use `IF EXISTS` clauses for safe rollback operations
  - [x] Include appropriate warnings for data loss risks
- [x] **Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints)**
- [x] **Test components in both light and dark mode**
- [x] **Verify mobile usability on devices 320px width and up**
- [x] Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG AA)
- [x] Use semantic HTML elements
- [x] **üö® MANDATORY: Clean up removal artifacts**
  - [x] **Never leave placeholder comments** like "// No usage tracking needed" or "// Removed for simplicity"
  - [x] **Delete empty functions/components** completely rather than leaving commented stubs
  - [x] **Remove unused imports** and dependencies after deletions
  - [x] **Clean up empty interfaces/types** that no longer serve a purpose
  - [x] **Remove dead code paths** rather than commenting them out
  - [x] **If removing code, remove it completely** - don't leave explanatory comments about what was removed

### Architecture Compliance

- [x] **‚úÖ VERIFY: Used correct data access pattern**
  - [x] Mutations ‚Üí Server Actions (`app/actions/co-investors.ts`)
  - [x] Queries ‚Üí lib functions (`lib/co-investors.ts`) for complex, direct in components for simple
  - [x] API routes ‚Üí Only for webhooks, file exports, external integrations
- [x] **üö® VERIFY: No server/client boundary violations in lib files**
  - [x] Files with server imports (next/headers, supabase/server, db) don't export client-safe utilities
  - [x] Client components can import utilities without pulling in server dependencies
  - [x] Mixed server/client files are split using `-client.ts` pattern
- [x] **üö® VERIFY: Proper context usage patterns**
  - [x] Components use available context providers (UserContext, UsageContext, etc.) instead of unnecessary props
  - [x] No duplicate data fetching when data is already available in context
  - [x] Context hooks used appropriately in components rendered inside providers
  - [x] No prop drilling when context alternative exists for the same data
  - [x] All context providers identified and mapped before designing component interfaces
- [x] **‚ùå AVOID: Creating unnecessary API routes for internal operations**
- [x] **‚ùå AVOID: Mixing server-only imports with client-safe utilities in same file**
- [x] **‚ùå AVOID: Prop drilling when context providers already contain the needed data**
- [x] **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Does this really need an API route or should it be a Server Action/lib function?**
- [x] **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Can client components safely import from all lib files they need?**
- [x] **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK: Are components using context hooks instead of receiving context data as props?**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Common Server/Client Boundary Pitfalls to Avoid**

**‚ùå NEVER DO:**

- Import from `next/headers` in files that export client-safe utilities
- Mix database operations with utility functions in same file
- Import from `@/lib/supabase/server` alongside client-safe functions
- Create utility files that both server and client components import without considering the import chain

**‚úÖ ALWAYS DO:**

- Separate server operations from client utilities into different files
- Use `-client.ts` suffix for client-safe utility files
- Re-export client utilities from main file for backward compatibility
- Test that client components can import utilities without errors

## 18. Second-Order Consequences & Impact Analysis

### AI Analysis Instructions

üîç **MANDATORY: The AI agent must analyze this section thoroughly before implementation**

Before implementing any changes, the AI must systematically analyze potential second-order consequences and alert the user to any significant impacts. This analysis should identify ripple effects that might not be immediately obvious but could cause problems later.

### Impact Assessment Framework

#### 1. **Breaking Changes Analysis**

- [x] **Existing API Contracts:** Enhanced co-investor data extraction may change data structures but maintains backward compatibility
- [x] **Database Dependencies:** New schema fields are optional - existing data continues to work
- [x] **Component Dependencies:** Network Intelligence Dashboard enhanced but maintains existing interface
- [x] **Authentication/Authorization:** No changes to user permissions or access patterns

#### 2. **Ripple Effects Assessment**

- [x] **Data Flow Impact:** Enhanced extraction provides richer data to existing dashboard components
- [x] **UI/UX Cascading Effects:** Network Intelligence Dashboard displays more detailed analytics
- [x] **State Management:** No changes to existing state management patterns
- [x] **Routing Dependencies:** No new routes or routing changes required

#### 3. **Performance Implications**

- [x] **Database Query Impact:** New queries for co-investor analytics may slightly increase database load
- [x] **Bundle Size:** New analytics components may increase client bundle size by ~50-100KB
- [x] **Server Load:** Enhanced AI extraction may increase processing time for document analysis
- [x] **Caching Strategy:** No changes to existing caching mechanisms

#### 4. **Security Considerations**

- [x] **Attack Surface:** No new external APIs or user inputs - all data from internal document processing
- [x] **Data Exposure:** Co-investor intelligence is internal business data - no external access concerns
- [x] **Permission Escalation:** No changes to user permissions or access controls
- [x] **Input Validation:** No new user inputs requiring validation - all data extracted from trusted documents

#### 5. **User Experience Impacts**

- [x] **Workflow Disruption:** Enhanced dashboard provides more insights without changing existing workflows
- [x] **Data Migration:** No user data migration required - enhancements are additive
- [x] **Feature Deprecation:** No existing features being removed or significantly changed
- [x] **Learning Curve:** New analytics features are additive and don't require user training

#### 6. **Maintenance Burden**

- [x] **Code Complexity:** New analytics algorithms add moderate complexity but follow existing patterns
- [x] **Dependencies:** New D3.js and react-force-graph-2d dependencies for network visualization
- [x] **Testing Overhead:** New analytics features require additional test coverage
- [x] **Documentation:** Analytics features need documentation for business users

### Critical Issues Identification

#### üö® **RED FLAGS - Alert User Immediately**

These issues must be brought to the user's attention before implementation:

- [ ] **Database Migration Required:** Changes that require data migration in production
- [ ] **Breaking API Changes:** Modifications that will break existing integrations
- [ ] **Performance Degradation:** Changes likely to significantly impact application speed
- [ ] **Security Vulnerabilities:** New attack vectors or data exposure risks
- [ ] **User Data Loss:** Risk of losing or corrupting existing user data

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **YELLOW FLAGS - Discuss with User**

These issues should be discussed but may not block implementation:

- [x] **Increased Complexity:** New analytics algorithms add complexity to the codebase
- [x] **New Dependencies:** D3.js and react-force-graph-2d for network visualization (~100KB bundle increase)
- [x] **UI/UX Changes:** Enhanced dashboard displays more detailed co-investor analytics
- [x] **Maintenance Overhead:** New analytics features require ongoing maintenance and documentation

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Database Changes

- [x] **Backup Strategy:** Ensure database backups before schema changes
- [x] **Rollback Plan:** Define clear rollback procedures for database migrations
- [x] **Staging Testing:** Test all database changes in staging environment first
- [x] **Gradual Migration:** Plan for gradual data migration if needed

#### API Changes

- [x] **Versioning Strategy:** Use API versioning to maintain backward compatibility
- [x] **Deprecation Timeline:** Provide clear timeline for deprecated features
- [x] **Client Communication:** Notify API consumers of breaking changes in advance
- [x] **Graceful Degradation:** Ensure old clients can still function during transition

#### UI/UX Changes

- [x] **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to gradually roll out UI changes
- [x] **User Communication:** Notify users of interface changes through appropriate channels
- [x] **Help Documentation:** Update help documentation before releasing changes
- [x] **Feedback Collection:** Plan for collecting user feedback on changes

### AI Agent Checklist

Before presenting the task document to the user, the AI agent must:

- [x] **Complete Impact Analysis:** Fill out all sections of the impact assessment
- [x] **Identify Critical Issues:** Flag any red or yellow flag items
- [x] **Propose Mitigation:** Suggest specific mitigation strategies for identified risks
- [x] **Alert User:** Clearly communicate any significant second-order impacts
- [x] **Recommend Alternatives:** If high-risk impacts are identified, suggest alternative approaches

### Example Analysis Template

```
üîç **SECOND-ORDER IMPACT ANALYSIS:**

**Breaking Changes Identified:**
- Database schema change will require migration of 10,000+ existing records
- API endpoint `/api/users` response format changing (affects mobile app)

**Performance Implications:**
- New JOIN query may slow down dashboard load time by 200ms
- Additional React components will increase bundle size by 15KB

**Security Considerations:**
- New user input field requires XSS protection
- API endpoint needs rate limiting to prevent abuse

**User Experience Impacts:**
- Navigation menu restructure may confuse existing users
- New required field will interrupt existing signup flow

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Implement database migration script with rollback capability
- Use API versioning to maintain backward compatibility
- Add performance monitoring for new queries
- Plan user communication strategy for UI changes

**üö® USER ATTENTION REQUIRED:**
The database migration will require approximately 30 minutes of downtime. Please confirm if this is acceptable for your deployment schedule.
