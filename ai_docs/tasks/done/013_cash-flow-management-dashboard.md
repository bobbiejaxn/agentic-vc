### Recommendation & Rationale

**üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:** Option 1 - Manual Entry + Forecasting Engine

**Why this is the best choice:**

1. **Practical Implementation** - Works immediately without external integrations
2. **Mario's Current Workflow** - Aligns with how he currently receives capital call notices
3. **Complete Control** - Mario can enter exact amounts and timing he receives
4. **Foundation for Automation** - Can add integrations later as fund portals modernize

**Key Decision Factors:**

- **Performance Impact:** Forecasting calculations are fast and don't affect dashboard performance
- **User Experience:** Simple manual entry interface fits Mario's current workflow
- **Maintainability:** No external API dependencies to maintain
- **Scalability:** Can handle Mario's 8+ fund relationships without integration limits
- **Security:** No external service access needed, data stays local

**Alternative Consideration:**
Option 2 would be preferred if fund portals had consistent APIs, but current API availability is too fragmented for reliable implementation.

## 3. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture

- **Frameworks & Versions:** Next.js 15.3, React 19, TypeScript 5.4 with strict mode
- **Database & ORM:** Supabase (Postgres) via Drizzle ORM for cash flow data persistence
- **UI & Styling:** shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling and theming
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth managed by `middleware.ts` for protected routes
- **Key Architectural Patterns:** Next.js App Router, Server Components for data fetching, Server Actions for mutations

### Current State

The current fund performance dashboard foundation exists but lacks cash flow management. Fund data structure supports capital calls and distributions tracking. The existing chart infrastructure provides a foundation for cash flow visualization.

### Existing Context Providers Analysis

- **UserContext (`useUser()`):** Available throughout protected routes - provides user profile and authentication state
- **UsageContext (`useUsage()`):** Available in protected routes - handles subscription/billing data
- **Context Hierarchy:** Both providers available in protected route layouts
- **Available Context Hooks:** `useUser()`, `useUsage()` - fund data not currently in context

**üîç Context Coverage Analysis:**

- Cash flow data will need new context provider for liquidity and capital management state
- No existing cash flow data in current contexts
- Components will need to fetch cash flow data via Server Components initially

// Cash flow data types
export interface FundCapitalCall {
  id: string;
  fundId: string;
  callDate: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  description?: string;
  status: "pending" | "paid" | "cancelled";
  dueDate?: string;
  noticeDate: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

export interface FundDistribution {
  id: string;

}
```

### Data Migration Plan

- [ ] Create fund_capital_calls, fund_distributions, and liquidity_forecasts tables
- [ ] Add appropriate indexes for query performance
- [ ] Add foreign key constraints and cascade deletes
- [ ] Validate data integrity after migration

### üö® MANDATORY: Down Migration Safety Protocol

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Before running ANY database migration, you MUST create the corresponding down migration file following the `drizzle_down_migration.md` template process:

- [ ] **Step 1: Generate Migration** - Run `npm run db:generate` to create the migration file
- [ ] **Step 2: Create Down Migration** - Follow `drizzle_down_migration.md` template to analyze the migration and create the rollback file
- [ ] **Step 3: Create Subdirectory** - Create `drizzle/migrations/[timestamp_name]/` directory
- [ ] **Step 4: Generate down.sql** - Create the `down.sql` file with safe rollback operations
- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Safety** - Ensure all operations use `IF EXISTS` and include appropriate warnings
- [ ] **Step 6: Apply Migration** - Only after down migration is created, run `npm run db:migrate`

**üõë NEVER run `npm run db:migrate` without first creating the down migration file!**

## 8. API & Backend Changes

### Data Access Pattern - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULES

**üö® MANDATORY: Follow these rules strictly:**

#### **MUTATIONS (Server Actions)** ‚Üí `app/actions/[feature].ts`

- [ ] **Server Actions File** - `app/actions/cash-flow.ts` - ONLY mutations (add capital call, record distribution, update forecast)
- [ ] Examples: `addCapitalCall()`, `recordDistribution()`, `updateLiquidityForecast()`
- [ ] Must use `'use server'` directive and `revalidatePath()` after mutations

#### **QUERIES (Data Fetching)** ‚Üí Choose based on complexity:

- [ ] **Direct in Server Components** - Simple cash flow queries for dashboard display
- [ ] **Query Functions in lib/cash-flow.ts** - Complex forecasting calculations and time-series analysis

### Server Actions

- [ ] **`addCapitalCall`** - Add new capital call with amount, date, and fund association
- [ ] **`updateCapitalCallStatus`** - Mark capital calls as paid or cancelled
- [ ] **`recordDistribution`** - Record fund distributions with type and tax implications
- [ ] **`generateLiquidityForecast`** - Create automated forecasts based on fund vintage and performance

### Database Queries

- [ ] **Direct in Server Components** - Simple queries for recent capital calls and distributions
- [ ] **Query Functions in lib/cash-flow.ts** - Complex forecasting algorithms and cash flow analysis

## 16. AI Agent Instructions

### Default Workflow - STRATEGIC ANALYSIS FIRST

üéØ **STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE:**
When a user requests any new feature, improvement, or significant change, your **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR** should be:

1. **EVALUATE STRATEGIC NEED** - Determine if multiple solutions exist or if it's straightforward
2. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS** (if needed) - Present solution options with pros/cons and get user direction
3. **CREATE A TASK DOCUMENT** in `ai_docs/` using this template
4. **GET USER APPROVAL** of the task document
5. **IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE** only after approval

**DO NOT:** Present implementation plans in chat without creating a proper task document first.
