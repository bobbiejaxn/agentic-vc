## 🎯 STEP 3: Immediate Action

### IF SIMPLE FIX:
**Fix it now:** [Provide direct solution]

### IF MISSING FILE/IMPORT:
**Check these files exist:**
```bash
# Commands to verify files/dependencies
```

### IF TYPE/INTERFACE ISSUE:
**Check these type definitions:** [Specific types to verify]

### IF ENVIRONMENT/CONFIG:
**Verify these settings:** [Specific env vars, config files]

### IF COMPLEX:
→ **Continue to Deep Investigation** (below)

## 🔍 DEEP INVESTIGATION (Only for Complex Issues)

### Step A: Systematic Codebase Exploration

**🔍 Investigation Process:**

<!-- AI Agent: Use these tools systematically to understand the codebase -->

1. **Find All Related Code** (Use codebase_search)
   - [ ] Search for error-related patterns: `"how does [failing component] work?"`
   - [ ] Search for similar implementations: `"where is [pattern] used elsewhere?"`
   - [ ] Search for data flow: `"how does data flow through [system area]?"`

2. **Map Component Relationships** (Use codebase_search + read_file)
   - [ ] Identify all imports/dependencies of failing component
   - [ ] Trace data flow upstream (what feeds into this?)
   - [ ] Trace data flow downstream (what depends on this?)
   - [ ] Check for circular dependencies or coupling issues

3. **Understand Architectural Context** (Use codebase_search)
   - [ ] Search: `"what is the architecture of [system area]?"`
   - [ ] Search: `"how do [ComponentA] and [ComponentB] interact?"`
   - [ ] Check for established patterns this code should follow

### Step B: Root Cause Analysis

**📍 Error Location:** [File, function, line number]

**🔄 Complete Flow Analysis:**
```
[User Action] → [Component A] → [Function B] → [Service C] → [ERROR POINT]
                     ↓              ↓              ↓
               [Expected State] [Expected Data] [Expected Result]
                     ↓              ↓              ↓  
               [Actual State]   [Actual Data]   [Actual Result]
```

**🚨 Discrepancy Analysis:**
- **Expected behavior:** [what should happen]
- **Actual behavior:** [what actually happens]
- **Break Point:** [where the divergence begins]
- **Root Cause:** [why the divergence happens]

### Step C: System Context Investigation

**🏗️ Architectural Assessment:**

<!-- AI Agent: Use codebase_search to understand system context -->

1. **Design Patterns Check:**
   - [ ] Is this following established patterns in the codebase?
   - [ ] Are there better examples of this pattern elsewhere?
   - [ ] Is this component trying to do too much (SRP violation)?

2. **Dependency Analysis:**
   - [ ] Are all required dependencies properly imported/configured?
   - [ ] Are there version conflicts or compatibility issues?
   - [ ] Are environment/config variables properly set?

3. **Data Flow Integrity:**
   - [ ] Is data properly validated at each step?
   - [ ] Are error cases handled gracefully?
   - [ ] Is state management consistent with rest of application?

### Step D: Code Quality & Best Practices Review

**🔧 Engineering Standards Check:**

<!-- AI Agent: Look for systematic code quality issues -->

1. **Code Quality Issues:**
   - [ ] Type safety problems (TypeScript/Python typing)
   - [ ] Missing error handling
   - [ ] Inconsistent naming conventions
   - [ ] Complex functions that should be broken down

2. **Best Practices Violations:**
   - [ ] Tight coupling between components
   - [ ] Missing validation/sanitization
   - [ ] Poor separation of concerns
   - [ ] Inadequate logging/debugging support

3. **Performance/Reliability Issues:**
   - [ ] Inefficient algorithms or queries
   - [ ] Missing caching where appropriate
   - [ ] Race conditions or timing issues
   - [ ] Resource leaks or cleanup problems

## 🚫 Common Template Mistakes to Avoid

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Fill out every section if not needed
- ❌ Speculate without error details
- ❌ Over-analyze simple typos
- ❌ Write essays when a quick fix will do

**DO:**
- ✅ Get error message first
- ✅ Start with simplest explanation
- ✅ Expand only if actually complex
- ✅ Focus on action over analysis

---

**💡 Remember:** Most bugs are simple. Start simple, expand only if needed.
