## ‚úÖ **SETUP: Project Context Analysis**

**Required Context Sources (Guaranteed to Exist):**
* `ai_docs/prep/app_name.md` - App identity and competitive positioning
* `ai_docs/prep/master_idea.md` - Core value proposition, target users, business model
* `ai_docs/prep/app_pages_and_functionality.md` - App structure and feature set
* `ai_docs/prep/ui_theme.md` - Color scheme, typography, visual identity, and background color system (critical for navbar theme fixes)
* `ai_docs/prep/roadmap.md` - Product roadmap and feature priorities
* `ai_docs/prep/wireframe.md` - User journey and page flow

**Additional Context Sources:**
* `global.css` - Existing theme tokens and custom styles
* `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind configuration and custom tokens
* `shipkit.json` - Template type identification (RAG/Chat/Agent)

**Current Implementation Analysis:**
* `app/(public)/page.tsx` and each imported section component
* Study existing sections: `HeroSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `ProblemSection`, `DemoSection`, etc.

**Reference Quality Standards (Built-In Heuristics):**
* **Outcome-first hero** - "Ship your AI applications in days, not months" leads with concrete outcome
* **Logical reveal** - Introduce core concepts, then expand with supporting details just-in-time
* **Just-in-time Q&A** - Answer visitor questions exactly when they arise in the journey
* **Scannability** - Clear headlines, bullet points, visual hierarchy for quick comprehension
* **Consistent rhythm** - Alternating backgrounds, consistent spacing, professional typography
* **Strong contrast** - Excellent readability in both light and dark modes
* **Mobile excellence** - Perfect responsive design from 320px to desktop

**üöë Fallback Strategies (If Context is Missing):**

If prep files are incomplete:
- **Tell them:** "It looks like something is missing from your prep documents"
- **List specific missing files** and request completion before proceeding
- **Do not proceed** with fallback assumptions - quality requires complete context

## ‚ú® **PROFESSIONAL DESIGN STANDARDS** (Non-Negotiable UI Rules)

Every generated section must follow these professional design principles to create beautiful, intentionally-designed interfaces:

**üé® Professional Design Principles:**
- **Single Color Focus** - Use one primary brand color + one complementary secondary (e.g., blue primary, red for warnings). Use the same primary color in both light and dark modes. Avoid multiple competing colors that distract users from important content
- **Professional Typography** - Choose from: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Rubik, Poppins, Lato, Space Grotesk, Lexend Deca, Playfair Display (serif), JetBrains Mono (code). Don't use generic system fonts (Arial, default Inter, Helvetica)
- **Context-Appropriate Spacing** - Use spacing that fits the content relationship, not uniform spacing everywhere. Consider element relationships when choosing spacing values
- **Professional Icons** - Use Lucide React icons relevant to content context, not generic emojis. Match strokeWidth to font weights: `strokeWidth={2.5}` for `font-semibold`, `strokeWidth={3}` for `font-bold`
- **Subtle Interactions** - Gentle hover effects (`hover:scale-105`, subtle bg variations). Avoid animations where elements keep moving as this makes apps look unprofessional
- **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear information organization with proper heading sizes, contrast, and spacing to guide user attention effectively

**üö´ Patterns to Always Avoid:**
- **No Gradients** - Completely avoid `bg-gradient-to-*` and `bg-clip-text text-transparent`. These patterns create unprofessional appearance
- **No Color Chaos** - Don't use blue, green, orange, purple competing for attention. Users can't focus with multiple bright colors
- **No Generic Fonts** - Don't use Arial, default Inter, Helvetica, or system fonts
- **No Poor Contrast** - Avoid black text on dark gray backgrounds or harsh white-on-black that isn't comfortable to view
- **No Animation Overload** - Don't use multiple moving background elements or unsmooth animations

**üéØ Technical Excellence:**
- **Consistent Max Width** - All sections (navbar, hero, content, footer) must use same max-width for perfect alignment
- **Navbar Theme Compliance** - ALWAYS read `ui_theme.md` background color system and update navbar from hardcoded theme colors (`bg-white/80 dark:bg-gray-900/80`, `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`) to proper CSS variables from their defined theme system (typically primary background with transparency and border variables)
- **Alternating Backgrounds** - Use alternating section backgrounds using background colors from `ui_theme.md` and `globals.css` for visual separation
- **Dark Mode Eye Comfort** - Use background colors easier on eyes, not harsh pure blacks (just an example: `bg-slate-900 dark:bg-slate-950` instead of `bg-black`)
- **Consistent Border Radius** - Use consistent `rounded-*` values throughout design for visual coherence
- **Icon Typography Harmony** - Match icon strokeWidth to text: icons with `font-semibold` use `strokeWidth={2.5}`, icons with `font-bold` use `strokeWidth={3}`
- **Button Component Integrity** - Never add manual spacing (`ml-*`, `mr-*`) to shadcn Button components - they handle spacing automatically
- **Mobile Excellence** - Design mobile-first with proper responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) and contextually appropriate spacing
- **Accessibility Compliance** - Ensure proper contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility

**üìê Section Height Guidelines:**
- Each section should show primary content within one viewport on desktop (minimal scrolling within section)
- Mobile sections should be scannable without excessive vertical scrolling
- Use efficient vertical space - not cramped but not wastefully spaced
- Content should be digestible at a glance while maintaining proper breathing room

## üé® **LAYOUT OPTIONS REFERENCE** (For AI Use - Not User-Facing)

**Hero Section Layouts:**
1. **Clean Minimalist Hero** - Super clean and minimalist with essential info only. Uses either split content layout (headline/CTAs left, visual right) or centered focus layout (all content centered). Perfect for message-driven apps
2. **Demo-Integrated Hero** - Minimalist design with app demo integrated. Shows functionality immediately while maintaining clean aesthetic. Best for apps where seeing the product drives conversion (eliminates need for separate demo section)

**Features Section Layouts:**
1. **Hover Card Grid** - Clean cards that subtly lift on hover with professional icons and descriptions. Easy to scan and engaging
2. **Category Sections** - Features grouped by user type or use case. Excellent for apps serving multiple audiences

**Problem/Context Section Layouts:**
1. **Split Problem-Solution** - Current pain points on left, your solution benefits on right. Clear visual contrast and logical flow
2. **Stats and Stories** - Industry statistics combined with relatable user scenarios. Builds credibility through data and emotion

**How It Works Section Layouts:**
1. **Progressive Steps** - Clean numbered progression with supporting visuals. Each step clearly leads to the next
2. **Split Demo** - Step explanations alongside live demo or mockup. Shows rather than just tells

**Demo Section Layouts:**
1. **Live Interaction** - Actual working interface users can interact with. Most convincing when technically feasible
2. **Guided Walkthrough** - Screenshot sequence with callouts highlighting key features. Professional and informative

**Demo Technical Requirements (Critical):**
- **Fixed Dimensions** - Demo must have fixed width and height to prevent layout shift during animations
- **No Dynamic Heights** - Content changes during demo animations must NOT cause height changes that trigger page scrolling or flickering
- **Mobile Responsive Priority** - Demo must look beautiful and responsive on mobile even if elements need to be simplified, hidden, or redesigned to prevent breaking layouts
- **Container Constraints** - Use `overflow: hidden` and fixed containers to ensure animations stay within defined boundaries
- **Consistent Viewport** - Demo area maintains same dimensions regardless of animation content state (loading, content, empty states)

**Use Cases Section Layouts:**
1. **Scenario Cards** - Different user types with their specific benefits. Helps visitors see themselves using your app
2. **Industry Spotlights** - Vertical-specific applications with relevant examples. Great for B2B tools with multiple markets

**Footer Section Layouts:**
1. **Minimal CTA Footer** - Clean, single row design with essential links, copyright, and final conversion opportunity. Perfect for apps focused on clean and minimal design while maximizing conversion potential
2. **Comprehensive Business Footer** - Multiple columns with organized link categories, contact info, and social media. Great for established businesses with multiple offerings

**üîß Implementation Task Generation:**

I'll create individual task files for each approved section, saved separately to `ai_docs/tasks/` using the task_template.md format.

**Task Creation Process:**
- **Step 0:** Generate `000_update_app_branding.md` (navbar with theme fix, footer, logo, metadata with correct app name. for the logo, NEVER REMOVE THE LOGO IMAGE, only update the app name. CRITICAL: Read `ui_theme.md` background color system and fix navbar theme colors from hardcoded `bg-white/80 dark:bg-gray-900/80` and `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700` to proper CSS variables from their theme system - typically the primary background variable with transparency like `bg-background/80` and `border-border`)
- **Step 1:** Generate `001_prepare_sections.md` (remove unwanted section files, create placeholder components for selected sections that return empty div elements with proper naming - e.g., `export default function HeroSection() { return <div></div>; }`)
- **Step 2:** Generate task files ONLY for sections the user selected:
  - Create task files for each section based on user's approved section list from Phase 1
  - Use naming like `002_landing_hero.md`, `003_landing_features.md`, etc. for selected sections only
  - **Important:** Skip demo section task if user chose "Demo-Integrated Hero" (demo is already in hero)
  
- Each task follows the complete task_template.md structure

**Task Implementation Guidance:**
After all tasks are created, recommend the user implement each task in a separate chat session for focused development.

**Your Validation**
1. Ready to generate the individual task files?
2. Any specific sections you want to prioritize first?
