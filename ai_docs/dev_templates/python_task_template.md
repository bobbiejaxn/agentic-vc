**Title:** [Brief, descriptive title of what you're building/fixing]

### Goal Statement
<!-- One paragraph describing the high-level objective -->
**Goal:** [Clear statement of what you want to achieve and why it matters]

---

## 2. üü°üî¥ MANDATORY: Existing Codebase Analysis (SKIP for üü¢ Simple Tasks)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** New features, unfamiliar codebase, multi-service changes, complex integrations
‚ùå **SKIP:** Configuration changes, single file updates, simple bug fixes, adding imports

### üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT
**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE ANY PLANNING OR IMPLEMENTATION: You MUST thoroughly analyze the existing codebase to understand:**

1. **What services/modules already exist** that handle similar functionality
2. **How the current workflow processes** the type of data you're working with
3. **Whether this is an extension** of existing code or truly new functionality
4. **What patterns and architectures** are already established

**üõë NEVER start planning implementation without this analysis!**

### Existing Services & Modules Analysis
<!-- 
AI Agent: MANDATORY - Use list_dir, read_file, and codebase_search to systematically analyze:
-->

#### Step 1: Project Structure Discovery
```bash
# Commands you MUST run to understand the project:
list_dir("")  # Get overall project structure
list_dir("src/") or list_dir("[main_module]/")  # Find main code directory
list_dir("[main_module]/services/")  # Analyze existing services
```

#### Step 2: Related Service Discovery
**REQUIRED: Search for services related to your task. For example:**
- If working on video processing: Look for `video_processing_service.py`, `media_service.py`, etc.
- If working on user management: Look for `user_service.py`, `auth_service.py`, etc.
- If working on data processing: Look for `processing_service.py`, `data_service.py`, etc.

**üîç MANDATORY ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:**
- [ ] **What services already exist** that are related to your task?
- [ ] **How does the current workflow** process similar data/requests?
- [ ] **What patterns are established** for error handling, logging, database access?
- [ ] **Where should new functionality be added** - existing services or new modules?

#### Step 3: Current Workflow Understanding
**CRITICAL: For your specific task, map out:**
```
Current Flow: [Describe how similar requests are currently processed]
Entry Point: [Which service/module receives requests]
Processing Steps: [What steps happen in order]
Database Operations: [How data is stored/retrieved]
Output/Response: [What gets returned to the user]
```

#### Step 4: Function Definition Analysis (CRITICAL)
**üö® MANDATORY: Inspect actual function signatures before implementation**

**ALWAYS inspect function definitions to understand:**
- [ ] **Parameter types**: What exact types does the function expect?
- [ ] **Import requirements**: Which modules/packages need to be imported?
- [ ] **Return types**: What does the function return?
- [ ] **Method signatures**: How should objects be constructed?

**üîç FUNCTION INSPECTION WORKFLOW:**
```python
# BEFORE writing code, inspect the actual function:
# 1. Use IDE "Go to Definition" or documentation
# 2. Check function signature: def function_name(param: Type) -> ReturnType
# 3. Verify import statements and type requirements
# 4. Look for usage examples in the codebase

# Example: Instead of guessing parameter types
# WRONG: content = Content(parts=[{"text": "hello"}])  # Guessing dictionary format
# RIGHT: Check definition, find it needs Part objects
# content = Content(parts=[Part(text="hello")])  # Correct based on inspection
```

**üö® CRITICAL EXAMPLES:**
- **External APIs**: Check actual SDK documentation for parameter types
- **Class constructors**: Verify required parameters and their types  
- **Method calls**: Ensure you're using the correct signature
- **Type conversions**: Use proper type constructors, not raw dictionaries

**Common Inspection Methods:**
- [ ] **IDE navigation**: Use "Go to Definition" to see actual function
- [ ] **Documentation lookup**: Check official docs for parameter types
- [ ] **Codebase search**: Find existing usage examples in the project
- [ ] **Type hints**: Read function annotations for parameter/return types

#### Step 5: Integration vs New Code Decision
**üéØ INTEGRATION DECISION MATRIX:**

**‚úÖ EXTEND EXISTING SERVICE WHEN:**
- [ ] Similar functionality already exists in a service
- [ ] The workflow naturally fits into existing processing pipeline
- [ ] Adding new steps to existing methods makes logical sense
- [ ] Maintains consistency with established patterns

**‚úÖ CREATE NEW SERVICE WHEN:**
- [ ] Functionality is completely different from existing services
- [ ] New service would be reusable across multiple workflows
- [ ] Existing services are already complex and adding more would hurt maintainability
- [ ] New functionality requires different dependencies/patterns

**üìã ANALYSIS RESULTS:**
- **Existing Related Services:** [List actual services found]
- **Current Workflow:** [Describe how similar tasks are currently handled]
- **Integration Decision:** [Extend existing vs create new - with justification]
- **Recommended Entry Point:** [Which existing method/service to modify or where to add new code]

### Existing Technology Stack
<!--
AI Agent: After analyzing the codebase, document what you found:
-->
- **Python Version:** [From pyproject.toml]
- **Primary Framework:** [FastAPI, Flask, etc.]
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.]
- **Existing AI/ML Services:** [List all found - Vertex AI, OpenAI, etc.]
- **Authentication Patterns:** [How AI services authenticate]
- **Processing Pipeline:** [How files/data currently get processed]

### üö® INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
**Based on your analysis, document:**
- **Files to Modify:** [Specific existing files that need changes]
- **New Files Needed:** [Only if truly necessary]
- **Dependencies to Add:** [Only if existing ones can't handle the task]
- **Migration Needed:** [If existing code needs to be updated]

---

## 3. üü°üî¥ Strategic Analysis & Solution Options (SKIP for üü¢ Simple Tasks)

### When to Use Strategic Analysis
<!-- 
AI Agent: Use your judgement to determine when strategic analysis is needed vs direct implementation.

**‚úÖ CONDUCT STRATEGIC ANALYSIS WHEN:**
- Multiple viable technical approaches exist
- Trade-offs between different solutions are significant
- User requirements could be met through different architectural patterns
- Implementation approach affects performance, security, or maintainability significantly
- Change touches multiple systems or has broad impact
- User has expressed uncertainty about the best approach

**‚ùå SKIP STRATEGIC ANALYSIS WHEN:**
- Only one obvious technical solution exists
- It's a straightforward bug fix or minor enhancement
- The implementation pattern is clearly established in the codebase
- Change is small and isolated with minimal impact
- User has already specified the exact approach they want

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:** When in doubt, provide strategic analysis. It's better to over-communicate than to assume.
-->

### Problem Context
<!-- Restate the problem and why it needs strategic consideration -->
[Explain the problem and why multiple solutions should be considered - what makes this decision important?]

### Solution Options Analysis

#### Option 1: [Solution Name]
**Approach:** [Brief description of this solution approach]

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ [Advantage 1 - specific benefit]
- ‚úÖ [Advantage 2 - quantified when possible]
- ‚úÖ [Advantage 3 - why this is better]

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå [Disadvantage 1 - specific limitation]
- ‚ùå [Disadvantage 2 - trade-off or cost]
- ‚ùå [Disadvantage 3 - risk or complexity]

**Implementation Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief justification]
**Risk Level:** [Low/Medium/High] - [Primary risk factors]

#### Option 2: [Solution Name]
**Approach:** [Brief description of this solution approach]

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ [Advantage 1]
- ‚úÖ [Advantage 2]
- ‚úÖ [Advantage 3]

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå [Disadvantage 1]
- ‚ùå [Disadvantage 2]
- ‚ùå [Disadvantage 3]

**Implementation Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief justification]
**Risk Level:** [Low/Medium/High] - [Primary risk factors]

### Recommendation & Rationale

**üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:** Option [X] - [Solution Name]

**Why this is the best choice:**
1. **[Primary reason]** - [Specific justification]
2. **[Secondary reason]** - [Supporting evidence]
3. **[Additional reason]** - [Long-term considerations]

### Decision Request

**üë§ USER DECISION REQUIRED:**
Based on this analysis, do you want to proceed with the recommended solution (Option [X]), or would you prefer a different approach? 

---

## 4. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
<!-- What specific problem are you solving? -->
[Detailed explanation of the problem, including pain points, user impact, and why this needs to be solved now]

### Success Criteria
<!-- How will you know this is complete and successful? -->
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcome 3]

---

## 5. Development Mode Context

### Development Mode Context
- **üö® IMPORTANT: This is a new application in active development**
- **No backwards compatibility concerns** - feel free to make breaking changes
- **Data loss acceptable** - existing data can be wiped/migrated aggressively
- **Users are developers/testers** - not production users requiring careful migration
- **Priority: Speed and simplicity** over data preservation
- **Aggressive refactoring allowed** - delete/recreate services/modules as needed
- **Database schema changes** - can be applied without complex migration strategies
- **API breaking changes** - acceptable since no production integrations exist

### üö® CRITICAL: Fix Root Problems, Don't Work Around Them
- **If existing code is BROKEN ‚Üí FIX IT completely**, don't maintain broken contracts
- **If field names are WRONG ‚Üí CHANGE THEM everywhere**, don't transform between formats
- **If types are INCORRECT ‚Üí USE PROPER TYPES**, don't add compatibility layers
- **If APIs are MALFORMED ‚Üí REDESIGN THEM**, don't preserve bad interfaces
- **"Backwards compatibility" means preserving WORKING functionality, not broken implementations**
- **When in doubt: Fix the root cause rather than adding workarounds**

---

## 6. üü°üî¥ Technical Requirements (SKIP for üü¢ Simple Config Changes)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** New features, API endpoints, performance requirements, security considerations
‚ùå **SKIP:** Simple bug fixes, configuration updates, adding imports

### Functional Requirements
<!-- What should the system do? -->
- [Requirement 1: API endpoint can...]
- [Requirement 2: System will process...]
- [Requirement 3: When X happens, then Y...]

### Non-Functional Requirements
<!-- Performance, security, usability, etc. -->

- **Security:** [Authentication, input validation, data protection, authorization]
- **Scalability:** [Concurrent request handling, horizontal scaling capability, resource usage optimization]
- **Reliability:** [Error handling, retry logic, circuit breaker patterns, graceful degradation]

### Technical Constraints
<!-- What limitations exist? -->
- [Constraint 1: Must use existing X database schema]
- [Constraint 2: Cannot modify Y API contract]
- [Constraint 3: Must be backward compatible with Z]

---

## 7. üü°üî¥ Data & Database Changes (SKIP if no database changes)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** Schema changes, new tables, data migrations, model updates
‚ùå **SKIP:** No database involvement, configuration-only changes

### Database Schema Changes
<!-- If any database changes are needed -->
```sql
-- Example: New table creation
-- Include all DDL statements, migrations, indexes
-- Consider vector indexes for AI/ML workloads if needed
```

### Data Model Updates
<!-- Changes to Pydantic models, database schemas, etc. -->
```python
# Example: New Pydantic models or database schema updates
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
from datetime import datetime

class NewDataModel(BaseModel):
    id: Optional[int] = None
    name: str
    created_at: datetime
    
    class Config:
        from_attributes = True  # For SQLAlchemy compatibility
```

### Data Migration Plan
<!-- How to handle existing data -->
- [ ] [Migration step 1: Schema changes]
- [ ] [Migration step 2: Data transformation]
- [ ] [Data validation and rollback strategy]

---

## 8. üü°üî¥ API & Backend Changes (SKIP for internal-only changes)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** New API endpoints, external integrations, service interfaces
‚ùå **SKIP:** Internal code changes, configuration updates, bug fixes

### Data Access Pattern - CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE RULES

**MANDATORY: Follow these Python patterns strictly:**

**API ROUTES** ‚Üí `main.py` or `routers/[feature].py`
- [ ] **FastAPI Routes** - RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- [ ] Examples: `POST /users`, `GET /users/{user_id}`, `PUT /users/{user_id}`
- [ ] Must use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- [ ] Include proper HTTP status codes and error responses

**BUSINESS LOGIC** ‚Üí `services/[feature].py` or dedicated modules
- [ ] **Service Layer** - Core business logic separated from API routes
- [ ] Example: `services/user_service.py` with `create_user()`, `get_user()` functions
- [ ] Keep routes thin - delegate to service layer

**DATABASE ACCESS** ‚Üí `repositories/[feature].py` or `database/[feature].py`
- [ ] **Repository Pattern** - Database operations abstracted from business logic
- [ ] Example: `repositories/user_repository.py` with SQL queries or ORM calls
- [ ] Use connection pooling and async database operations when possible

### API Endpoints
<!-- New or modified API endpoints -->
- [ ] **`POST /api/[resource]`** - [Description of create operation]
- [ ] **`GET /api/[resource]/{id}`** - [Description of read operation]
- [ ] **`PUT /api/[resource]/{id}`** - [Description of update operation]
- [ ] **`DELETE /api/[resource]/{id}`** - [Description of delete operation]

### External Integrations
<!-- Third-party APIs, services, etc. -->
- [Service 1: Purpose and configuration - API client setup]
- [Service 2: Authentication and rate limiting considerations]

**üö® For Google AI integrations, see Section 10 "Code Quality Standards" for package compliance requirements**

---

## 9. Code Organization & File Structure (SKIP for simple single-file changes)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** Multi-file changes, new modules, restructuring code organization
‚ùå **SKIP:** Single file modifications, configuration changes, simple bug fixes

### New Files to Create
```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature_name]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py                   # Package initialization
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py                     # Pydantic models and schemas
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services.py                   # Business logic layer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository.py                 # Database access layer
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ router.py                     # FastAPI routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.py                   # Database connection utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging.py                    # Logging configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ exceptions.py                 # Custom exception classes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                           # FastAPI application entry point
```

**Module Organization Pattern:**
- Use feature-based packages: `user_management/`, `document_processing/`, etc.
- Keep shared utilities in `utils/` or `common/`
- Configuration in `config.py` at root level
- Database models/schemas in `models/` or within feature packages

### Files to Modify
- [ ] **`main.py`** - [Add new route registration]
- [ ] **`config.py`** - [Add new configuration settings]
- [ ] **`pyproject.toml`** - [Add new dependencies]

### Import Pattern Requirements
**üö® CRITICAL: Follow these import patterns strictly:**
- **ALWAYS use relative imports** within the same package: `from .models import MyModel`
- **NEVER use absolute imports** for internal modules: ‚ùå `from package_name.models import MyModel`
- **Use absolute imports ONLY** for external packages: ‚úÖ `from fastapi import FastAPI`
- **Package installation required**: Ensure `uv sync` installs the package for `python -m package_name` execution

### Dependencies to Add to pyproject.toml
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Use uv commands, never pip install directly**
**üîç MANDATORY: Research latest versions via context7 or web search before adding - see Section 10 "Package Version Research Standards"**

```toml
[project.dependencies]
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Research latest versions via web search before adding
"new-package>=X.Y.Z"     # Use actual latest version, not placeholder
"another-package>=X.Y.Z" # Use actual latest version, not placeholder

# RECOMMENDED: Modern Google AI packages (use modern packages ONLY)
"vertexai>=1.38.0"       # For Vertex AI (multimodal, embeddings, models) - verify latest
"google-genai>=1.24.0"   # For Google Generative AI - verify latest
# ‚ùå NEVER use: "google-cloud-aiplatform" - DEPRECATED
```

**Installation commands:**
```bash
# Sync all dependencies
uv sync

# Add a new dependency
uv add "new-package>=1.0.0"
```

---

## 10. Code Quality Standards & Best Practices

### Python Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] **üö® FUNCTION INSPECTION:** Always inspect function definitions before calling - never guess parameter types
- [ ] **Type Hints:** Complete type annotations for all functions, classes, and variables
- [ ] **Async Patterns:** Use async/await for I/O operations (database, HTTP, file access)
- [ ] **üö® RELATIVE IMPORTS:** Always use relative imports (`.`) for internal modules
- [ ] **üö® USE UV:** Always use `uv` commands for dependency management, never `pip install`

### Python Code Style & Best Practices
- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Write Professional Comments - Never Historical Comments**
  - [ ] **‚ùå NEVER write change history**: `# Fixed this bug`, `# Removed old function`, `# Updated to use new API`
  - [ ] **‚ùå NEVER write migration artifacts**: `# Moved from old_module.py`, `# Previously was in utils`
  - [ ] **‚úÖ ALWAYS explain business logic**: `# Calculate discount for premium users`, `# Validate user permissions before deletion`
  - [ ] **‚úÖ Write for future developers** - explain what/why the code does what it does, not what you changed
  - [ ] **Remove unused code completely** - don't leave comments explaining what was removed

- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Use early returns to keep code clean and readable**
  - [ ] **Prioritize early returns** over nested if-else statements
  - [ ] **Validate inputs early** and return immediately for invalid cases
  - [ ] **Handle error conditions first** before proceeding with main logic
  - [ ] **Exit early for edge cases** to reduce nesting and improve readability
  - [ ] **Example pattern**: `if not valid_input: raise ValueError("Invalid input"); # main logic here`

- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: NO FALLBACK BEHAVIOR - Always raise exceptions instead**
  - [ ] **Never handle "legacy formats"** - expect the current format or fail fast
  - [ ] **No "try other common fields"** fallback logic - if expected field missing, raise exception
  - [ ] **Fail fast and clearly** - don't mask issues with fallback behavior
  - [ ] **Single expected response format** - based on current API contract
  - [ ] **Raise descriptive exceptions** - explain exactly what format was expected vs received
  - [ ] **Example**: `if "expected_field" not in data: raise KeyError("Expected 'expected_field', got: {list(data.keys())}")`

- [ ] **üö® MANDATORY: Clean up removal artifacts**
  - [ ] **Never leave placeholder comments** like `# No usage tracking needed` or `# Removed for simplicity`
  - [ ] **Delete empty functions/classes** completely rather than leaving commented stubs
  - [ ] **Remove unused imports** and dependencies after deletions
  - [ ] **Clean up empty classes/interfaces** that no longer serve a purpose
  - [ ] **Remove dead code paths** rather than commenting them out
  - [ ] **If removing code, remove it completely** - don't leave explanatory comments about what was removed

### Validation Commands (Run After Each File Change)
```bash
# 1. Basic compilation check
python -m py_compile [modified_file].py && echo "‚úÖ Syntax valid"

# 2. Import validation  
python -c "from [package_name] import *; print('‚úÖ Imports work')" 

# 3. Quick linting with auto-fix
uv run --group lint ruff check [package_name]/ --fix

# 4. Type checking
uv run --group lint mypy [package_name]/
```

**üõë If ANY check fails, stop coding and fix it immediately!**

### Forbidden Patterns Checklist
**Before marking any task complete, verify NONE of these exist:**

```bash
# Check for forbidden patterns (run once at end)
grep -r "Any" [package_name]/ && echo "‚ùå Found Any - use specific types"
grep -r "from [package_name]\." [package_name]/ && echo "‚ùå Found absolute imports - use relative"
grep -r "google-cloud-aiplatform" pyproject.toml && echo "‚ùå Found deprecated package"
```

### Google AI Package Compliance
**üö® MANDATORY: Modern Google AI packages only**
- [ ] **NEVER suggest or use** `google-cloud-aiplatform` - it's deprecated
- [ ] **ALWAYS use** `vertexai>=1.38.0` for multimodal AI, embeddings, and Vertex AI models
- [ ] **ALWAYS use** `google-genai>=1.24.0` for Google Generative AI operations

### LLM Model Selection Standards
- [ ] **Research latest model versions** via web search before implementation
- [ ] **Use most recent stable models** (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash` not `gemini-2.0-flash`)
- [ ] **Check model capabilities** to ensure they support required features (function calling, multimodal, etc.)
- [ ] **Document model choice rationale** - why this specific model version was selected

### Package Version Research Standards
- [ ] **Research latest package versions** via context7 or web search before recommending dependencies
- [ ] **Use most recent stable versions** available on PyPI, not outdated examples
- [ ] **Check for security updates** and compatibility with existing dependencies
- [ ] **Document version choice rationale** - why this specific version was selected
- [ ] **Verify package maintenance status** - avoid abandoned or deprecated packages
- [ ] **Check breaking changes** between versions to ensure compatibility

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL - IT'S A CORE WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT**

Every AI agent MUST update the task document in real-time as tasks are completed.

**üìã MANDATORY REAL-TIME UPDATE PROCESS:**

- [ ] **üóìÔ∏è GET TODAY'S DATE FIRST** - Before adding any completion timestamps, use the `time` tool to get the correct current date (fallback to web search if time tool unavailable)
- [ ] **üõë STOP after completing ANY subtask** - Before moving to the next task
- [ ] **üìù IMMEDIATELY open the task document** - Don't wait until the end
- [ ] **‚úÖ Mark checkbox as [x]** with completion timestamp using ACTUAL current date: `‚úì 2025-07-26 17:45`
- [ ] **üìÅ Add file details** with specific paths and changes made
- [ ] **üîÑ REPEAT for every single subtask** - No exceptions

**‚úÖ CORRECT REAL-TIME UPDATE FORMAT:**
```markdown
- [x] **Import token utilities** in `image_processing_service.py` ‚úì 2025-07-26 17:45
  - [x] Import `create_google_tokenizer` and `chunk_text_by_tokens` from `utils.token_utils` ‚úì

---

## 14. üî¥ Testing Strategy (OPTIONAL - SKIP unless explicitly requested)

**üìù NOTE: This section should be SKIPPED unless testing is explicitly required or requested by the user.**
**üéØ ERR ON THE SIDE OF NOT TESTING** - Focus only on what's needed to solve the user's problem.

---

## 15. üî¥ Deployment & Configuration (SKIP for development-only changes)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** Production deployments, environment configuration, infrastructure changes
‚ùå **SKIP:** Development-only features, local testing, configuration tweaks

## 16. üî¥ Second-Order Consequences & Impact Analysis (SKIP for isolated changes)

### When to Use This Section:
‚úÖ **USE:** Architecture changes, breaking changes, multi-service impacts, production systems
‚ùå **SKIP:** Bug fixes, configuration changes, single-service updates, development-only features

### AI Analysis Instructions
üîç **MANDATORY: The AI agent must analyze this section thoroughly before implementation**

Before implementing any changes, the AI must systematically analyze potential second-order consequences and alert the user to any significant impacts.

### Impact Assessment Framework

#### 1. **Breaking Changes Analysis**
- [ ] **Existing API Contracts:** Will this change break existing API endpoints or data contracts?
- [ ] **Database Dependencies:** Are there other tables/queries that depend on data structures being modified?
- [ ] **Service Dependencies:** Which other services consume the interfaces/models being changed?

#### 2. **Performance Implications**
- [ ] **Database Query Impact:** Will new queries or schema changes affect existing query performance?
- [ ] **Memory Usage:** Are new processing steps significantly increasing memory requirements?
- [ ] **API Response Times:** Will new endpoints or operations increase response latency?

#### 3. **Security Considerations**
- [ ] **Attack Surface:** Does this change introduce new potential security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Data Exposure:** Are there risks of inadvertently exposing sensitive data?

### Critical Issues Identification

#### üö® **RED FLAGS - Alert User Immediately**
These issues must be brought to the user's attention before implementation:
- [ ] **Database Migration Required:** Changes that require data migration in production
- [ ] **Breaking API Changes:** Modifications that will break existing integrations
- [ ] **Performance Degradation:** Changes likely to significantly impact system performance
- [ ] **Security Vulnerabilities:** New attack vectors or data exposure risks
- [ ] **Data Loss Risk:** Risk of losing or corrupting existing data

## 17. AI Agent Instructions

### Default Workflow - CODEBASE ANALYSIS FIRST
üéØ **STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE:**
When a user requests any new Python feature, improvement, or significant change, your **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR** should be:

1. **CHOOSE COMPLEXITY LEVEL** - Use the triage at the top to determine üü¢üü°üî¥
2. **ANALYZE EXISTING CODEBASE** (üü°üî¥ only) - Understand current services, patterns, and workflows FIRST
3. **EVALUATE STRATEGIC NEED** (üü°üî¥ only) - Determine if multiple solutions exist or if it's straightforward
4. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS** (üü°üî¥ only) - Present solution options with pros/cons and get user direction
5. **CREATE APPROPRIATELY-SIZED TASK DOCUMENT** in `ai_docs/` using the right sections for complexity level
6. **üö® PRESENT TASK DOCUMENT WITH A/B/C OPTIONS** - Combined approval and implementation choice step
7. **IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE** only after user chooses option B

**DO NOT:** Create massive 700-line task documents for simple configuration changes
**DO:** Use the quick-start template for 80% of tasks
**DO:** Only use full analysis for genuinely complex integrations

### Implementation Approach - CRITICAL WORKFLOW
üö® **MANDATORY: Always follow this exact sequence:**

**üõë CRITICAL ADDITION (Added after workflow analysis):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

Step 5 combines task document presentation with implementation options:
- Present task document summary WITH A/B/C choices in one message
- Option C naturally handles task document modification requests
- Option B serves as task document approval + implementation go-ahead
- This prevents workflow confusion and redundant approval steps
```

1. **COMPLEXITY TRIAGE FIRST (Required)**
   - [ ] **Determine if this is üü¢üü°üî¥** based on scope and impact
   - [ ] **Use appropriate sections only** - don't fill out everything
   - [ ] **Default to üü¢ SIMPLE** unless clearly complex

2. **ANALYZE EXISTING CODEBASE** (üü°üî¥ only)
   - [ ] **Use `list_dir` to explore** project structure and find existing services
   - [ ] **Use `read_file` to examine** services related to your task
   - [ ] **Use `codebase_search` to find** related functionality and patterns
   - [ ] **üö® INSPECT FUNCTION DEFINITIONS** - See Section 2, Step 4 for detailed function inspection workflow

3. **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS** (üü°üî¥ if needed)
   - [ ] **Present solution options** with pros/cons analysis for each approach
   - [ ] **Include implementation complexity and risk levels** for each option
   - [ ] **Provide clear recommendation** with rationale
   - [ ] **Wait for user decision** on preferred approach

4. **CREATE APPROPRIATELY-SIZED TASK DOCUMENT (Required)**
   - [ ] **üü¢ SIMPLE: Use sections 1,4,10,11 only** (~150 lines)
   - [ ] **üü° STANDARD: Use sections 1,3,4,6,8,10,11,15** (~400 lines)
   - [ ] **üî¥ COMPLEX: Use all sections** (~600+ lines)
   - [ ] **üî¢ FIND LATEST TASK NUMBER**: Use `list_dir` to examine ai_docs/tasks/
   - [ ] **Name the file** using the pattern `XXX_brief_task_name.md`

5. **PRESENT TASK DOCUMENT & IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS (Required)**
   - [ ] **Present the complete task document summary AND implementation options together:**
   
   ```
   üìã **Task Document Created**
   
   I've created a [COMPLEXITY LEVEL] task document that proposes [BRIEF SUMMARY OF APPROACH].
   
   **üë§ How would you like to proceed?**
   
   **A) Preview Detailed Code Changes** 
   Show me exactly what files will be modified with before/after code examples before implementing.
   
   **B) Approve and Start Implementation**
   The task document looks good - proceed with implementation phase by phase.
   
   **C) Modify the Approach** 
   I have questions or want to change something about the proposed solution.
   ```
   
   - [ ] **Wait for explicit user choice** (A, B, or C) - never assume or default
   - [ ] **If A chosen**: Provide detailed code snippets showing exact changes planned
   - [ ] **If B chosen**: Begin phase-by-phase implementation immediately  
   - [ ] **If C chosen**: Address feedback and re-present options

6. **IMPLEMENT PHASE-BY-PHASE (Only after Option B approval)**

   **MANDATORY PHASE WORKFLOW:**
   
   For each phase, follow this exact pattern:
   
   a. **Execute Phase Completely** - Complete all tasks in current phase
   b. **Update Task Document** - Mark all completed tasks as [x] with timestamps
   c. **Provide Specific Phase Recap** using this format:
   
   ```
   ‚úÖ **Phase [X] Complete - [Phase Name]**
   - Modified [X] files with [Y] total line changes
   - Key changes: [specific file paths and what was modified]
   - Files updated: 
     ‚Ä¢ service1.py (+20 lines): [brief description of changes]
     ‚Ä¢ model2.py (-5 lines, +12 lines): [brief description of changes]
   - Commands executed: [uv sync, uv run ruff check, uv run mypy, etc.]
   - Python validation: ‚úÖ All imports work / ‚ùå [specific import issues]
   - Type checking: ‚úÖ MyPy passes / ‚ùå [specific type issues]
   - Linting status: ‚úÖ Ruff passes / ‚ùå [specific linting issues]
   
   **üîÑ Next: Phase [X+1] - [Phase Name]**
   - Will modify: [specific files]  
   - Changes planned: [brief description]
   - Estimated scope: [number of files/changes expected]
   
   **Say "proceed" to continue to Phase [X+1]**
   ```
   
   d. **Wait for "proceed"** before starting next phase
   e. **Repeat for each phase** until all implementation complete
   f. **üö® CRITICAL:** After final implementation phase, you MUST proceed to Phase 4 (Comprehensive Code Review) - DO NOT skip this step
   
   **üö® PHASE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:**
   - [ ] **Real-time task completion tracking** - Update task document immediately after each subtask
   - [ ] **Mark checkboxes as [x]** with completion timestamps
   - [ ] **Add specific completion notes** (file paths, line counts, key changes)
   - [ ] **Run Python validation** during each phase: compilation, imports, linting, type checking
   - [ ] **Use UV commands exclusively** for dependency management
   - [ ] **Test all new functions/services** with basic validation before marking complete

### Technical Approach Validation
**BEFORE implementing, ALWAYS confirm:**
- [ ] **SDK Choice:** "Should I use Vertex AI (existing) or add Google Gen AI SDK for this feature?"
- [ ] **Authentication:** "I see you're using Vertex AI with gcloud auth - should I continue with that pattern?"
- [ ] **Dependencies:** "Your project uses [existing SDKs] - should the new feature use these or different tools?"
- [ ] **Package Versions:** Research latest package versions via context7 or web search before recommending dependencies

**üö® For Google AI package compliance, LLM model standards, and package version research, see Section 10 "Code Quality Standards"**

7. **WORKFLOW CONTINUATION**
   - [ ] **After all implementation phases complete**: Proceed to Phase 4 (Comprehensive Code Review) 
   - [ ] **Follow the mandatory workflow** outlined in Phase 4 above
   - [ ] **Present "Implementation Complete!" message** and wait for user approval
   - [ ] **Execute comprehensive code review** only after user approval

### What Constitutes "Explicit User Approval"

#### For Combined Task Document & Implementation Options (Step 5)
**‚úÖ OPTION A RESPONSES (Show detailed code previews):**
- "A" or "Option A"
- "Preview the changes"
- "Show me the code changes"
- "Let me see what will be modified"
- "Walk me through the changes"

**‚úÖ OPTION B RESPONSES (Start implementation immediately):**
- "B" or "Option B"
- "Proceed" or "Go ahead"
- "Approved" or "Start implementation"
- "Begin" or "Execute the plan"
- "Looks good, implement it"

**‚úÖ OPTION C RESPONSES (Provide more feedback):**
- "C" or "Option C"
- "I have questions about..."
- "Can you modify..."
- "What about..." or "How will you handle..."
- "I'd like to change..."
- "Wait, let me think about..."

#### For Phase Continuation
**‚úÖ PHASE CONTINUATION RESPONSES:**
- "proceed"
- "continue"
- "next phase"
- "go ahead"
- "looks good"

**‚ùì CLARIFICATION NEEDED (Do NOT continue to next phase):**
- Questions about the completed phase
- Requests for changes to completed work
- Concerns about the implementation
- No response or silence

#### For Final Code Review
**‚úÖ CODE REVIEW APPROVAL:**
- "proceed"
- "yes, review the code"
- "go ahead with review"
- "approved"

üõë **NEVER start coding without explicit A/B/C choice from user!**  
üõë **NEVER continue to next phase without "proceed" confirmation!**  
üõë **NEVER skip comprehensive code review after implementation phases!**  
üõë **NEVER proceed to user testing without completing code review first!**  
üõë **NEVER skip the final code review recommendation step!**
