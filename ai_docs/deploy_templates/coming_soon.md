# Deploy Templates - Coming Soon! 🚀

Hey everyone!

I completely ran out of time before launch for creating all of the additional `deploy_templates` to help with purchasing an email account, setting up MailGun, and adding analytics. But I will be knocking this out as the **first task** I do post-launch.

I will send an email announcement to let you guys know as soon as the templates are ready and the updated videos are live.

Also, just as a quick reminder, you can always get updates for your ShipKit projects by running the `update_template_workflow`.

If you have any questions, please let me know. And thank you guys for being so understanding! 🙏

**What's Coming:**

- 📧 Email account setup guides
- 📮 MailGun integration templates
- 📊 Analytics implementation workflows
- 🎥 Updated video tutorials

Stay tuned!
