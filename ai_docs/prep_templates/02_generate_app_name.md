## ‚úÖ **SETUP: Carefully Analyze User Input**

You'll receive only one input: a detailed **Master Idea Document**.

Before generating names:

* **Carefully summarize the app idea in 1‚Äì2 clear sentences**, ensuring you fully grasp the context, unique value proposition, target user, and core features.
* Clearly highlight key concepts, keywords, and phrases directly from the user's document, specifically noting:

  * **Target audience:** (extract from Master Idea Document)
  * **Core value proposition:** (extract main benefit/outcome from document)
  * **Unique product differentiators:** (extract key features that set apart from competitors)

**Then immediately proceed to Phase 1** - no additional questions needed.

---

# **PHASE 1: Locally Generated Names (Best Practices)**

**CRITICAL DOMAIN STRATEGY:**
- **Always include domain extension** with each name (ModelFlow.io, ChatSwitch.ai)
- **No single-word domains** unless they are realistic word fragments (unif.ai)  
- **Focus on compound names** with available domains vs. premium single words
- **Use only valid extensions** - see reference list below

**Valid Domain Extensions Reference:**
- **.com** - Most trusted, widely available (~$15/year)
- **.ai** - Popular for AI companies ($140-200/year) 
- **.co** - Alternative to .com, good availability (~$30/year)
- **.io** - Tech startups (many short domains taken, ~$50/year)
- **.tech** - Technology focused, good availability (~$50/year)
- **.app** - Application focused, newer gTLD (~$20/year)
- **Country codes for hacks**: .st (S√£o Tom√©), .cy (Cyprus) - use only for realistic word fragments
  - **Avoid .ly (Libya)**: Has content restrictions and regulatory complications

## üè∑Ô∏è **Short Evocative Names (Word Fragment Domain Hacks Only)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Skip this entire section if no realistic word fragments exist.**

Most single-word domains cost $50k+ or use invalid extensions. Only generate names here if you can create realistic word fragments.

**Word Fragment Criteria:**
- Must be fragment of a relevant word (unif.ai from "unify")
- Must use valid, available domain extension
- Must be clearly pronounceable and memorable

**If criteria not met ‚Üí Skip to Metaphorical Names section**

## üöÄ **Metaphorical Names (Always Include Domain)**

Professional metaphors with available domains (focus on workflow/efficiency positioning):

* **[Generate metaphor + .ai/.io/.com domain]** *(professional positioning metaphor)*
* **[Generate workflow metaphor + domain]** *(efficiency/productivity focus)*
* **[Generate connection metaphor + domain]** *(unified access positioning)*
* **[Generate 2-3 additional professional metaphors]** *(with domains and rationales)*

## üé© **Compound Names (Always Include Domain)**

Compound names that clearly communicate value proposition with realistic domains:

* **[Generate Function + AI/Tech + domain]** *(clear functionality communication)*
* **[Generate Benefit + Tool/Platform + domain]** *(clear value proposition)*
* **[Generate Process + AI/Flow + domain]** *(workflow efficiency focus)*
* **[Generate 3-4 additional compounds]** *(with domains and clear value props)*

## üèóÔ∏è **Extended Descriptive Names (Premium Domain Availability)**

3-word descriptive names that combine key concepts for excellent .com availability at standard prices:

* **[Generate AI + Core Feature + Tool/Platform + .com]** *(combines AI focus, main functionality, and solution type)*
* **[Generate Smart/Pro + Main Function + System/Hub + .com]** *(professional positioning with clear functionality)*
* **[Generate Multi/Unified + AI + Core Benefit + .com]** *(emphasizes key differentiator with AI positioning)*
* **[Generate Target User + AI + Solution Type + .com]** *(clear audience targeting with AI focus)*
* **[Generate Action/Process + AI + Platform/Tool + .com]** *(verb-based functionality with AI and solution type)*

**Strategy:** 3-word names (12-20 characters) typically have excellent .com availability at $15/year vs. shorter premium domains costing $50k+. These names sacrifice brevity for affordability and clear positioning.

## üèÜ **Y Combinator Style Names (Brandable & Memorable)**

Learn from successful YC companies: how to transform your app's core purpose into a cool, brandable name.

### **The YC Transformation Pattern**

Study how successful startups went from **Company Purpose ‚Üí Cool Name**:

**üöó Uber** - *Taxi/ride service* ‚Üí **"Uber"** *(ultimate, superior - positions as premium solution)*
**üöó Lyft** - *Ride sharing* ‚Üí **"Lyft"** *(creative spelling of "lift" - friendlier than competitors)*  
**üí≥ Stripe** - *Payment processing* ‚Üí **"Stripe"** *(clean, fast lines - suggests speed and simplicity)*
**üí¨ Slack** - *Team communication* ‚Üí **"Slack"** *(relaxed efficiency vs formal enterprise tools)*
**üé® Figma** - *Design collaboration* ‚Üí **"Figma"** *(creative, design-focused sound)*
**üìû Twilio** - *Communication APIs* ‚Üí **"Twilio"** *(sounds like "two-way" communication)*

### **Apply This Pattern to Your App**

**CRITICAL: Analyze your app's core purpose first, then generate names using these strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Creative Spellings** *(Take relevant words and make them cooler)*
* **[Generate creative spelling of core function + domain]** *(like Lyft from "lift")*
* **[Generate creative spelling of key benefit + domain]** *(memorable twist on familiar concept)*

**Strategy 2: Repurposed Common Words** *(Familiar words with new tech meaning)*  
* **[Generate common word that relates to your solution + domain]** *(like Stripe, Slack)*
* **[Generate action/feeling word that describes user experience + domain]** *(emotional connection)*

**Strategy 3: Invented Brandable Words** *(Professional-sounding made-up names)*
* **[Generate tech-sounding invented word + domain]** *(like Figma, Twilio)*
* **[Generate 4-6 character brandable name + domain]** *(short, memorable, pronounceable)*

**Domain Strategy:** YC-style names often secure premium .com domains or use creative extensions (.ly, .io, .ai) that enhance the brand story.

# **PHASE 2: Deep Competitive Research**

**Purpose:** Give user "wow I didn't know these companies existed" insights and identify positioning gaps.

### **Required Web Research (Perform All):**

**CRITICAL: Actually perform these web searches - do not simulate or make up results.**

**Get Current Year First:** Use time tool to get current year, then use it in all searches.

**Execute These 5 Searches (Use Web Search Tool):**
1. `"{core functionality} SaaS platforms [current year]"`
2. `"best {target user} tools for {problem solved} [current year]"`  
3. `"{main functionality} alternatives to {major competitor} [current year]"`
4. `"{user's core benefit} software companies [current year]"`
5. `"{industry} startup names YC backed [current year]"`

### **Competitor Documentation Structure:**

**For Each Competitor Found, Document:**

**[Company Name]** - [their domain]
- *What they do:* [Brief description of their solution]
- *Naming strategy:* [Pattern analysis - metaphor/compound/short, domain choice]  
- *Positioning:* [Consumer/Enterprise/Developer focused, pricing tier]
- *Gap for you:* [Specific opportunity this creates for differentiation]

**Lesser-Known Competitors (Wow Factor):**
- Focus on companies user probably hasn't heard of
- Include domain strategies they use (.gg, .ly, creative TLDs)
- Highlight unique positioning approaches

- [List successful naming patterns found]
- [Note domain strategies that work] 
- [Identify positioning approaches that resonate]

**Positioning Gaps:**
- [Specific market positions that are underserved]
- [Professional vs. consumer positioning opportunities]
- [Workflow/efficiency focus opportunities]

### **Domain Availability Quick-Check (Required):**

**For Each Name Generated in Phase 1, Check:**
1. **Google search**: `"[AppName] app"` and `"[AppName] software"` 
2. **Domain search**: `"[AppName].com domain available"` and `"[AppName].[extension] available"`
3. **Conflict check**: `"[AppName]" + [industry keywords]` to find existing products

**Availability Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ **Available**: Clean search results, no major conflicts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potentially Conflicted**: Similar existing products, suggest variations  
- ‚ùå **Taken/Expensive**: Direct conflicts, major existing products using name

---

# **PHASE 3: Research-Informed New Names**

**Purpose:** Generate names that strategically differentiate from competitors based on research insights.

## üéØ **Professional Power User Names**
*Names that position as enterprise/professional vs. consumer competitors*

* **[Workflow-focused name + domain]** *(emphasizes productivity gap in market)*
* **[Professional title + AI + domain]** *(professional positioning vs. casual competitors)*
* **[Advanced/Pro + concept + domain]** *(sophisticated user focus)*

## üöÄ **Advanced Workflow Names**  
*Names that emphasize efficiency/productivity gaps competitors miss*

* **[Streamline/Efficiency concept + domain]** *(workflow focus missing from competitors)*
* **[Unify/Unified concept + domain]** *(unified experience vs. fragmented solutions)*
* **[Professional workspace metaphor + domain]** *(business environment positioning)*

## ‚ö° **Speed/Efficiency Differentiation Names**
*Names that emphasize speed/efficiency if competitors lack this focus*

* **[Speed concept + domain]** *(rapid/quick/swift + functionality)*
* **[Efficiency concept + domain]** *(streamlined experience focus)*
* **[Performance concept + domain]** *(high-performance positioning)*
