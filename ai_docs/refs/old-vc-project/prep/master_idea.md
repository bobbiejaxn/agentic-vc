**Design Philosophy - Scandinavian Minimalism:**
The visual system prioritizes semantic, text-driven interfaces with extremely sparse color usage. Following Scandinavian design principles, the interface relies on clear, meaningful text labels over icons, with whitespace and typography defining separation rather than colored boxes or lines.

**Financial Data Standards:**
All financial numbers (IRR, MOIC, portfolio values) are rendered using Inter with tabular numerals enabled, ensuring perfect vertical alignment and effortless scannability. This monospaced approach is mandatory for all financial data presentation.

**UI/UX Principles:**

- Semantic text labels replace icon-based navigation wherever possible
- Ultra-sparse color palette reserves accent colors only for critical focus states and error/success cues
- Visual hierarchy achieved through typography size, weight, and semantic naming
- Negative space defines content groupings, avoiding visual ornamentation
- Calm, trustworthy interfaces that feel effortless and unforced

The visual identity embodies The Sage archetype through precision, clarity, and wisdom - every element serves a semantic purpose, creating a professional environment that builds confidence through visual clarity and functional beauty.
