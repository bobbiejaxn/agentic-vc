#### System/Background

1. **Multi-Agent Document Processing** — When a user uploads a fund report, the system routes it to specialized agents (Fund Document Agent, Portfolio Intelligence Agent, Network Analysis Agent) that process in parallel, validate cross-references, and generate a quality score before presenting results to the user.

2. **Automated Data Validation** — When extraction completes, the system cross-validates calculated values against stated values, checks temporal consistency (vintage years vs investment dates), detects entity duplicates, and flags discrepancies with severity scoring for human review.

3. **Real-Time Portfolio Synchronization** — When new data is extracted or validated, the system updates portfolio dashboards, recalculates performance metrics, triggers concentration alerts if thresholds are breached, and sends notifications to affected users within 2 seconds.

4. **Intelligent Agent Learning** — When users provide feedback or corrections on extracted data, the system retrains specialized agents using BAML and Claude Agent SDK to improve accuracy for similar document types, achieving continuous improvement toward 99% accuracy targets.

### Value-Adding Features (Advanced)

- **Real-Time Document Quality Scoring:** As documents are uploaded, immediately score quality (0-100) based on completeness, consistency, calculation accuracy, and flag critical errors before processing. Builds trust in automation and reduces manual validation work.

- **Custom Sector-Specific AI Agents:** Allow users to train specialized agents for specific sectors (CleanTech, HealthTech, FinTech) that understand domain-specific metrics and terminology. Creates clear upgrade incentive from Professional to Institutional tier.

- **Co-Investor Network Intelligence:** Automatically map relationships between co-investors, score their quality based on track record, and identify warm introduction paths through shared connections. Network effect creates competitive moat as database grows.

- **Automated Capital Call Forecasting:** ML models predict future capital calls based on fund deployment patterns, investment pace, and historical data to prevent over-commitment. Prevents €50k+ losses from poor liquidity management.

- **Multi-Currency Portfolio Consolidation:** Automatically handle currency conversions, track FX exposure across investments, and provide hedging recommendations. Table-stakes for family offices managing global portfolios.

- **Benchmark Intelligence Reports:** Anonymized peer comparison showing how user's portfolio performance ranks against similar investors in sector, stage, and geography. Network effects make this more valuable as user base grows.
