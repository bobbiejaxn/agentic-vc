# Management Letter (i/iii) 

Dear Limited Partners,

We are pleased to share the Q1 2025 quarterly report for the Merantix Capital AI Fund.

## Team:

We are thrilled to welcome Matilda Glynn-Henley as our newest full-time addition to the investment team in London. Matilda first joined Merantix as a Visiting Analyst in 2024, where she contributed to the sourcing and evaluation of multiple ventures, including our portfolio company Hoshii. She holds a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Oxford University and brings a rare combination of deep technical expertise and strong commercial acumen to the team.

## Operations:

Some time ago, we made the decision to manage our second fund, the Merantix AI Fund, using the digital fund administration platform Bunch. Based on the positive experience we've had, we have now decided to also transition the Merantix MX Fund II to Bunch. The migration is planned for Q3 2025, meaning our LPs will receive one more report in the current format before all communication and reporting will be handled through Bunch going forward.

The key benefits of this transition include:

- A centralized data room with all relevant fund and portfolio information
- Digital resolutions via DocuSign
- Digital capital calls and distribution notices

If you have any questions in advance, please feel free to reach out to Oliver Schmied (oliver@merantix.com). Otherwise, we will provide you with a detailed briefing ahead of the transition.

## Events

After the huge success of our Al House in Davos, Q1 brought several other event highlights:

- START Summit: We hosted the AI pitch competition at the annual START Summit in St. Gallen, Switzerland. The competition was won by LogicStar AI, who are creating "Silicon developers" that can debug code on their own.
- Thought leadership:
- Switching costs and how to spot them: Rasmus shared his view on how AI ventures can create defensibility from Day One in an environment where switching costs for customers are decreasing rapidly.
- Deep Dive Healthcare: Rasmus shared his perspective on AI's much needed role in healthcare towards optimizing hospital logistics, reducing physician burnout, enhancing disease detection, and improving patient care.
- AI Breakfast - Manufacturing: Adrian hosted a breakfast session on how AI redefines the future of manufacturing via automation, AI agents, and a cultural shift toward software-first thinking together with NGP Capital, Delita, and HOLY Technologies.
- Merantix portfolio spotlights:
- Libra v2 launch: Our portfolio company LIBRA (previous vintage) launched the new version of their platform, enhancing legal workflows with specialized AI and a new legal-focused LLM, Noxtua. Adrian sat down with Director of Growth Henrik Volkmann to discuss how Libra is freeing up lawyers for strategic work while ensuring full GDPR and BRAO compliance. They grew 60\% MoM since Sept-24 and currently stand at EUR 400K ARR.
- Forbes 30 under 30: Our OVOM founder Felicia von Reden (previous vintage) has been picked as one of the Forbes 30 under 30 in Science \& Healthcare.

# Management Letter (iii/iii) 

## Navigating the Agentic AI Hype

Over the past months, we looked closely at several promising Agentic AI ventures which made a few things very clear:

- Crowded Field: In virtually every vertical - whether finance, healthcare, construction or logistics - we're now seeing dozens of startups pitching agent-based solutions. Yet not all of them are truly differentiated. The best founders understood something crucial: succeeding in this market isn't about adding an agent to a workflow for the sake of it. It's about solving a real problem, achieving a real precision threshold (often starting at $50-70 \%$ and climbing to $90 \%$ and beyond), and embedding deeply with design partners to prove the agent's value in practice.
- Strategic Data Access as a Moat: One pattern stood out especially - the best founders often have an unfair advantage when it comes to accessing real-world data. That kind of access is rare. Most operational data sits deep within siloed systems, and very few companies are willing to share it with early-stage startups. But real-world data is often the key to pushing model accuracy and building agents that actually perform in the wild. Founders who already come from within the target industry - or who have secured strategic data partnerships early - are miles ahead when it comes to building defensible AI products.
- Speed of Engagement: Another insight is just how critical speed has become. The best opportunities are won or lost before a formal fundraising process even begins. Building founder relationships early - sometimes pre-deck, pre-product - has become the key to staying competitive. With our AI Campus in Berlin and the new London AI Hub, we are well positioned to be part of these founder journeys from day zero.
- Domain Expertise Matters: Deep domain expertise is proving to be a real moat. It's not enough to be a great AI engineer. To succeed, you need to truly understand the workflow you are trying to transform. Founders who have lived the pain points they are solving - and who can blend that insight with AI-native product thinking - are the ones who are building with clarity and speed.

At Merantix Capital, we remain excited about the long-term potential of Agentic AI. But we are also committed to cutting through the noise, staying disciplined, and backing the teams that can truly turn this technology into category-defining businesses. Thank you for your continued support, and let's keep the momentum going!

Best,
Adrian, Rasmus, and the Merantix Capital Team
