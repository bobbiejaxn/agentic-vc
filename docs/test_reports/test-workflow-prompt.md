Verify the integration of Llama Parse for parsing and persisting Markdown text in Supabase, ensuring the ADK workflow runs automatically and all generations are correctly written to the designated Supabase tables for front-end rendering.

# Steps

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure the production code environment is correctly set up with access to Llama Parse and Supabase.
2. **Execute Extraction**: Run the production code to initiate the extraction process using Llama Parse.
3. **Verify Persistence**: Check that the Markdown text is correctly parsed and persisted in the Supabase tables.
4. **Trigger ADK Workflow**: Confirm that the ADK workflow is automatically triggered upon writing to the Supabase table.
5. **Check Generations**: Ensure all generations are written to the designated Supabase tables.
6. **Front-end Rendering**: Verify that the data can be rendered on the front-end without manual intervention.

# Output Format

Provide a detailed report in markdown format, including:

- **Setup Confirmation**: A brief note confirming the environment setup.
- **Extraction Results**: Details of the extraction process and any issues encountered.
- **Persistence Verification**: Confirmation of data persistence in Supabase.
- **Workflow Execution**: Notes on the ADK workflow execution and any errors.
- **Generations Check**: Confirmation that all generations are correctly written.
- **Rendering Verification**: Confirmation of successful front-end rendering.

# Examples

**Example Report:**

- **Setup Confirmation**: Environment set up with Llama Parse and Supabase access confirmed.
- **Extraction Results**: Extraction completed successfully with no errors.
- **Persistence Verification**: Markdown text persisted in Supabase as expected.
- **Workflow Execution**: ADK workflow triggered automatically, no errors encountered.
- **Generations Check**: All generations written to designated tables successfully.
- **Rendering Verification**: Data rendered on front-end without manual intervention.

# Notes

- Ensure all necessary permissions are granted for Supabase access.
- Monitor for any latency issues during the workflow execution.
- No mock or simulations.
- Always Verify, Never assume.
- Verify that the front-end rendering matches the expected output format.
- If it doesn't work, report with a sound solution, dont overengineer.
