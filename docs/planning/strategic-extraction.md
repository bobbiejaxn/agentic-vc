## Extraction Architecture

### Google ADK Multi-Agent Pattern

The extraction system uses Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with a multi-agent architecture:

1. **Retriever Agent**

   - Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Purpose: Extract raw data from Mistral OCR output
   - Input: Document chunks from `enhancedHybridChunks` table
   - Output: Raw financial data points

2. **Formatter Agent**

   - Model: Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - Purpose: Structure raw data into Tier 1 schema
   - Input: Raw data from retriever agent
   - Output: Structured JSON matching `Tier1FinancialMetrics` schema

3. **Sequential Workflow**
   - Orchestrates retriever → formatter pipeline
   - Stores results in `agentExtractionResults` table
   - Tracks confidence scores and processing time

### Technology Stack

- **OCR**: Mistral OCR API (`mistral-ocr-2505`)
- **Agents**: Google ADK (`google.adk.agents`)
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash (fast, cost-effective)
- **Database**: Convex (real-time, vector search)
- **Chunking**: Convex hybrid chunking
