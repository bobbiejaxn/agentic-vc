### Design Psychology - Scandinavian Minimalism

**Emotional Impact:** Professional blue evokes trust, stability, and confidence - essential for VC professionals managing significant capital. Combined with Scandinavian minimalism, creates calm, unforced beauty and effortless user experience.

**Brand Messaging:** Reinforces the Sage archetype as the "wise advisor" through quiet, trustworthy design. Scandinavian principles of functional beauty align perfectly with the Sage's wisdom and clarity.

**UI Philosophy:** Text-driven interfaces with semantic meaning over decorative elements. Financial data presented with monospaced precision. Ultra-sparse color palette creates focus and reduces cognitive load.

**Competitive Advantage:** Differentiated through sophisticated minimalism - not busy like consumer tools or overly complex like institutional platforms. Creates clear visual separation as the "thoughtful, professional VC intelligence platform."

### Background Color System

**Primary Background Color:**

- **Light Mode:** 220¬∞ 15% 98% (`--background`) - Clean, bright foundation with subtle blue undertone
- **Dark Mode:** 220¬∞ 15% 8% (`--background`) - Professional dark with blue-tinted sophistication
- **Usage:** Main content areas, landing page sections, portfolio dashboards, report interfaces

**Secondary Background Color:**

- **Light Mode:** 220¬∞ 10% 95% (`--muted`) - Subtle blue-tinted secondary areas
- **Dark Mode:** 220¬∞ 10% 15% (`--muted`) - Blue-tinted muted areas maintaining brand cohesion
- **Usage:** Sidebars, alternating sections, secondary content areas, card backgrounds

**Design Strategy:** The blue-tinted background system creates professional visual hierarchy while maintaining the Sage archetype's wisdom and clarity. Blue undertones throughout reinforce trust and stability essential for VC professionals.
