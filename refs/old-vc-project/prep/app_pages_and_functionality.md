### UI/UX Design Principles - Scandinavian Minimalism

**Semantic Text-Driven Interface:**

- All navigation and actionable UI controls use clear, meaningful text labels instead of icons
- Financial data (IRR, MOIC, portfolio values) rendered with Inter font + tabular numerals for perfect alignment
- Ultra-sparse color palette - accent colors reserved only for critical focus states and error/success cues
- Visual hierarchy achieved through typography size, weight, and semantic naming rather than colored boxes

**Financial Data Standards:**

- ALL numerical data must use Inter with tabular numerals enabled for effortless scannability
- Monospaced presentation mandatory for portfolio values, percentages, and performance metrics
- Text content accessible with clear contrast, no jargon, graceful expansion for longer text

**Accessibility & Usability:**

- Interfaces feel calm, trustworthy, and effortless following Scandinavian ethos
- Real user testing ensures text-driven navigation never impedes core workflows
- Responsive adaptation through semantic scale, not visual ornamentation
