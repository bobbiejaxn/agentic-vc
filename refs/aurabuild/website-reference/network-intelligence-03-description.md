# Network Intelligence Interface - Screenshot 3 Description

## Overview
This third screenshot of the network intelligence interface shows an alternative visualization mode, presenting the same network data in a different analytical perspective. The view appears to focus on network flows, hierarchies, or temporal analysis rather than the traditional force-directed graph layout.

## Layout and Structure

### Alternative Visualization Mode

- **Tree-like Branching**: Primary branches extending from the root node
- **Secondary Branches**: Sub-branches and tertiary connections
- **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal nodes representing endpoints in the hierarchy

#### Flow Visualization
- **Directed Flow Lines**: Arrows indicating direction of influence, investment, or data flow
- **Flow Intensity**: Line thickness or color intensity showing volume or strength
- **Convergence Points**: Nodes where multiple flows converge
- **Divergence Points**: Nodes where flows split into multiple paths
