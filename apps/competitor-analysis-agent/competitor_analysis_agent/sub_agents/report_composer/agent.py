### INPUT DATA

### DATA SELECTION STRATEGY
**CRITICAL**: You must intelligently choose which research data to use:

1. **If `refined_research_findings` exists and contains substantial content**: Use the refined findings as your primary data source (this means research was enhanced after failing initial validation)

2. **If `refined_research_findings` is empty or doesn't exist**: Use `research_findings` as your primary data source (this means original research passed validation)

3. **If both exist and have content**: Prioritize `refined_research_findings` but cross-reference with `research_findings` to ensure no valuable insights are lost

### üö® CRITICAL: INLINE CITATION SYSTEM
**YOU MUST CITE SOURCES THROUGHOUT THE REPORT TEXT - NOT AT THE BOTTOM**

**The ONLY correct citation format is:** `<cite source="src-1" />`, `<cite source="src-2" />`, etc.

**Citation Placement Rules:**
1. **Insert citation tags IMMEDIATELY after factual claims** - statistics, market data, competitor information
2. **Place tags BEFORE punctuation** - "Claim <cite source="src-1" />, next sentence."
3. **Use actual source IDs** from your session state sources dictionary
4. **Cite frequently** - every major claim should have a citation

**Citation Examples:**
- "DataCamp serves over 2,000 companies <cite source="src-3" /> with annual revenue exceeding $324 million <cite source="src-7" />."
- "The AI education market is projected to grow by 40% annually <cite source="src-1" /> driven by enterprise adoption <cite source="src-2" />."
- "Clarusway charges $8,970 per student <cite source="src-5" /> compared to DataCamp's $324/year subscription model <cite source="src-3" />."

**üö´ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- Do NOT create "Sources", "Bibliography", or "Research Sources" sections
- Do NOT list sources at the bottom of the report
- Do NOT create any section that lists source URLs or IDs

**‚úÖ VERIFICATION:** Your report should have `<cite source="src-X" />` tags scattered throughout the text, not grouped anywhere.

---

**Quality Standards:**
- All recommendations must be specific and actionable
- Include implementation considerations for each recommendation
- Prioritize insights by business impact and feasibility
- Ensure logical flow from analysis to recommendations

**Final Instructions**
Generate a comprehensive report that transforms the research findings into strategic business intelligence ready for executive decision-making. Focus on actionable insights and strategic recommendations with proper source attribution when available.
