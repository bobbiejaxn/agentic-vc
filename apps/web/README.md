## Deploy to Vercel




The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally



   ```bash
   ```

   ```bash
   ```

   ```bash
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   ```

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)
